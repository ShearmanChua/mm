       "[{'content': \" Trump, Saudi King Agree to Back Safe Zones in Syria and Yemen The White House says President Donald Trump and Saudi King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud have agreed to back safe zones in Syria and Yemen. The two spoke by telephone Sunday, reaffirming the longstanding relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. A White House statement said Trump asked for the king's support for safe zones, and that the king agreed. Trump spent the last two days reaching out by telephone to a number of world leaders. He also was to talk Sunday with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, and acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-Ahn. He spoke Saturday to Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivers a speech at a local meeting of her Christian Democrats in Grimmen, northern Germany, Jan. 28, 2017. In a much anticipated call, Trump also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, agreeing to cooperate in defeating Islamic State and work for peace in Syria and throughout the world. Neither side mentioned U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia, or the possibility they could be eased. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks by phone with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Jan. 28, 2017.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Israeli Forces Work to Clear West Bank Settlement Israeli security forces continued working Thursday to clear the last remaining people from an illegal Jewish settlement in the West Bank. The operation to clear the Amona outpost began Wednesday with police confronting hundreds of residents and protesters who set up barricades and threw stones at officers. By Thursday, the focus was on the synagogue in Amona where remaining settlers had planted themselves inside. Ultra-conservative Israeli officials fought to reverse the ruling. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved 3,000 new homes for the evacuated settlers and others elsewhere in the West Bank. Jewish settlers run from police outside the Amona outpost in the West Bank, Feb. 1, 2017. The military issued eviction orders the day before, telling residents to evacuate Amona within 48 hours and blocked roads leading to the outpost. As Amona's uprooted residents and their supporters bemoaned their fate, Arabs in a neighboring Palestinian village clapped and shook hands. Israel's Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the Amona settlement had been built on private Palestinian land and would have to be demolished, over the objections of ultraconservative Israeli officials who fought to reverse the ruling. Amona, in the West Bank Built in the 1990s, Amona stretches out over a rugged, grassy hilltop and looks out across a valley onto Palestinian villages. Palestinians say Jewish settlements on land they want as part of a future state are a major impediment to peace. Israel says the Palestinians' refusal to recognize the Jewish state is blocking Mideast peace. Settlers burn tires outside the Amona outpost in the West Bank, Feb. 1, 2017. The military issued eviction orders the day before, telling residents to evacuate Amona within 48 hours and blocked roads leading to the outpost. Israel was furious when the United States, under former President Barack Obama, abstained instead of vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution in December calling the settlements illegal and demanding that Israel stop building them. The new Trump White House has so far been silent on Israeli settlement construction, but Jewish settlers told reporters Wednesday that they expected the new U.S. administration would not stand in the way of a new wave of settlements in the West Bank. Settler families leave their homes in the West Bank outpost of Amona, Feb. 1, 2017. Israeli forces have begun evacuating the controversial settlement, which is the largest of about 100 outposts erected in the West Bank without permission.\",\n",

Map of Jonestown, Guyana (VOA/Mark Sandeen) Some white church leaders distanced themselves from Jones, criticizing him for opening his doors to black Americans. He had a dark side that became more evident as his church moved from Indiana to California and, ultimately, Guyana. Jones had grown up poor and struggled in a deeply dysfunctional family. His message of racial equality and a socialist society was unusual and drew poor and disenfranchised converts.

       " {'content': \" Fifth Protester Killed as Venezuela Unrest Intensifies Venezuela's opposition was planning protests in each of the country's 335 municipalities on Thursday, in a bid to strain the capabilities of security forces as unrest mounted in the volatile nation. The oil-rich but crisis-shaken South American country has been convulsed by escalating protests over the last two weeks amid a punishing economic recession and accusations that leftist President Nicolas Maduro has morphed into a dictator. In a worrying sign for Maduro, people in usually pro-government slums and low-income areas have blocked streets and lit fires during scattered protests this week. A crowd also broke through a security cordon at his rally on Tuesday, heckling at him and throwing stones while bodyguards scrambled. Four people were killed during protests over the last week, authorities say. Opposition lawmaker Alfonso Marquina said on Thursday a fifth protester had died. The public prosecutor's office says it will investigate the death of 36-year-old Miguel Colmenares, according to the Associated Press. He was shot at a protest Tuesday in the central city of Barquisimeto. Gruseny Calderon was killed during the same protest, the Associated Press reports, adding that Marquina says the 32-year-old protester was injured by rubber bullets that pierced his lung and liver. The protests have also claimed the lives of two college students and a 13-year-old. Demonstrators rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, April 13, 2017. With momentum on their side, the main opposition coalition was urging Venezuelans to take to the streets across the country Thursday in an effort to leave security forces too thinly spread to break up rallies. They accuse police and the National Guard of indiscriminate use of tear gas, including gassing clinics and dropping canisters from a helicopter, and of arbitrarily detaining people for simply being within the vicinity of protests. The opposition says Maduro made it clear to the world he was a dictator when the Supreme Court in late March assumed the functions of the opposition-led congress. Amid global outcry, the court quickly rolled back the most controversial part of its decision, but the move breathed new life into the fractured opposition movement and comforted demonstrators that they had international support. Last week's move to ban opposition leader Henrique Capriles from holding office for 15 years also fueled demonstrators' outrage. Capriles is seen as the opposition's best presidential hope. Unrest Alongside planned opposition marches that have dissolved into clashes, there have also been what witnesses and local media describe as impromptu nighttime protests, where neighbors block streets with trash or burning debris. FILE - A demonstrator is arrested by riot police while rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, April 10, 2017. Looting has been reported too, especially in the working-class community of Guarenas outside Caracas. The opposition has responded that any social advances made under Chavez have been wiped out by a devastating economic crisis that has brought widespread shortages of food and medicine. Many Venezuelans still worry protracted protests will not bring about political or economic change, but will just increase violence in the already volatile nation. Major anti-government protests in 2014 eventually fizzled out, though the opposition at the time had nebulous demands, poor neighborhoods largely abstained, and the economy was in better shape.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Turkey, West in Standoff Over Syrian Refugees More than 25,000 Syrian civilians have become the unwitting victims of a standoff between Turkey and Western relief agencies. The Turkish government refuses to admit the refugees, the first in a wave of civilians fleeing an offensive by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the northern Aleppo countryside. Turkish officials say their country has reached the limit on the number of Syrian refugees it can admit. A delegation of EU lawmakers was told Monday that the border will remain closed. In a bid to pressure the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, United Nations and Western relief agencies are refusing to dispatch aid across the border to the refugees. Syrian Refugee Crisis Both officials asked not to be named in this article. The trucks that crossed were from the Independent Doctors Association, a private Syrian charity, the Turkish Red Crescent and IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, a Turkish NGO. Most of the half-dozen trucks carried tents and camp construction material. Trucks carry tents and construction material to be used for make-shift refugee housing, in Oncupinar, Turkey, Feb. 8, 2016. The supplies are destined for refugees on Syrian territory whom Ankara refuses entry into Turkey. (Photo - J. Dettmer/VOA) Desperation at border He said some of the displaced civilians, though, had gone further afield and his mission was not able to estimate their number. He said the refugees are desperate to cross into Turkey. The men have to relieve themselves in the fields. The Syrian Red Crescent estimates that 25,000 civilians are now close to the border near Oncupinar, some sheltering in nearby villages. Turkish officials put the number at more than 35,000 Syrians. Members of the press are seen at the Oncupinar border crossing, Turkey, Feb. 8, 2016. Ankara is refusing to allow dozens of Western journalists at Oncupinar eager to cover the refugee story to cross the border into Syria. (Photo - J. Dettmer/VOA) Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN-Turk television Sunday his country has taken in three million refugees from neighboring countries, most of them Syrians. In the meantime, the Syrian Red Crescent's Ibrahim says the Turks are planning to ship across another 250 smaller tents for families. While the Turkish government is refusing to let in Syrian refugees, it is refusing to allow out dozens of Western journalists at Oncupinar eager to cover the story. Syrians already registered in Turkey are allowed back and forth across the border, especially during religious holidays.\",\n",

It comes on a glorious night when nine reindeer zoom into the sky at the North Pole and carry his sleigh full of toys around the globe, stopping at house after house where he descends down the chimney with a gift for ever good little boy and girl inside. The anticipation of an entire year builds after nightfall. Parents urge kids to go to bed and let visions of sugarplums dance in their heads, lest he arrive to find them awake and dash away to the next house without stopping. But the children cannot get the question of the night out of their minds: When will Santa Claus get here? WATCH: Norad's 2015 Santa tracker That is where the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, comes in. There's an app for that There is also a Twitter account and Facebook page, as well as apps for Windows, Android and Apple mobile devices that have the same tracking information and games found on the website. The apps can be set to eight different languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese and Chinese. FILE - Air Force Lt. Col. David Hanson, of Chicago, takes a phone call from a child in Florida at the Santa Tracking Operations Center at Peterson Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Dec. 24, 2014. In 1955, the Sears Roebuck & Co. department store placed an ad in a Colorado Springs newspaper with a phone number for kids to call and speak to Santa. Fortunately for the kids, the staff working that Christmas leapt into action and put their radar equipment to work keeping tabs on the jolly man in the big red suit. There were 2.8 billion people in the world in 1955, and now there are more than two and a half times that number. That gives Santa, and his trackers, a big challenge for their one-day mission that will come down to the last second before they return home and get ready for the next Christmas.\",\n",

An announcement many waited a lifetime for was now a reality. FILE - A screenshot from Cuban television shows President Raul Castro addressing the country, in Havana, Dec. 17, 2014. But a year after the historic step, many Cubans say conditions on the island remain the same. Issues of concern According to Cubans interviewed by Voice of America, topics of concern such as human rights, access to the Internet, political prosecution, food shortages and low wages remain unchanged. The White House hoped this opening would create a better environment for human rights on the island. But so far, according to dissidents and opposition organizations, that has not happened. FILE - An opposition activist is detained by Cuban security officers ahead of a march marking International Human Rights Day in Havana, Cuba, Dec. 10, 2014. Fariñas is opposed to normalizing relations. Fariñas argues that in the past year there has been an increase in temporary arrests by government security forces to 1,200 to 1,500 each month. He said that in 2014, the numbers were around 700 to 800 a month. Every Sunday for more than 30 consecutive weeks this year, the Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, an opposition movement formed by wives and other female relatives of Cuban jailed dissidents, have marched in the Miramar neighborhood of Havana. These protesters constantly face the censorship of the Cuban government and according to people on the island, they have also faced increased levels of violence. Human rights The State Department said it brings up human rights in meetings between U.S. and Cuban delegations every few months. Cuban cigar-maker Habanos S.A. predicted in February it would gain 25 percent to 30 percent of the U.S. premium cigar market if the U.S. lifts its trade embargo on Cuba. Despite the efforts, many Cubans say the repression continues. Commercial conditions The U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments announced in January and September a series of steps to ease commercial and economic limits imposed on Cuba that among other things make it easier for Americans to travel to the island. They also allow more business transactions between the American and Cuban private sectors. Regulatory changes permitted U.S. telecommunications and Internet companies to engage more on the island, which many hoped would translate into better and faster Internet connectivity for Cubans.

Claudio Fuentes, a Cuban photographer based in Havana, and also a member of Estado de SATS, a policy and cultural organization, said that before all these changes, the Castro administration had blamed economic conditions on the U.S. trade embargo. And now, the government is digging in its heels. Obama has stated he wants the embargo to be lifted. This is not likely to happen anytime soon with a Republican majority in Congress that not only opposes lifting it, but the entire process of normalization. If the embargo were lifted, some Cubans believe they would see the government's true colors.

The crackdown has caused concern, particularly after five bloggers critical of the government vanished in January. When they re-emerged, clearly shaken, they refused to talk about what had happened to them amid speculation they were kidnapped and tortured by Pakistan's powerful military intelligence service. Living in the Netherlands, one said he felt he could never return to Pakistan after being called a blasphemer by a TV host.

Last week, Islamabad High Court Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui ordered blasphemous content removed from social media and broke down in tears while issuing his ruling. Sharif posted on Twitter that he expected daily updates from officials and told them to contact international social media platforms, such as Facebook, to seek their cooperation. The government has requested help from Interpol in tracking the sources of questionable content. Established with a secular government, Pakistan has steadily leaned toward conservative Islamic policies in recent years, reflecting a social trend. Effort to silence seen Advocates of free speech in Pakistan think the government is trying to shut up its critics. Osama Khilji, an internet freedom activist, said the government and the court seemed unable to deal with specific social media outlets and that the court order had created fear among users of all such platforms. The crackdown also is leading to questions about what's blasphemous and what isn't, and whether the government might be behind any of the hundreds of pro-administration voices on Facebook and Twitter that blast dissidents and neighboring Afghanistan and India.

       " {'content': \" AP Interview: Trump Narrows VP List as He Moves Into General But in a break from recent major party nominees, Trump does not plan to invest heavily in a data-driven effort to target voters in the fall campaign. Despite pressure, the billionaire businessman also does not expect to release his tax returns before the November election. He's cited an ongoing audit of his finances as the main reason for withholding the information, and also has said he doesn't believe voters are interested. Trump's comments came as he begins to ramp up for a long, expensive general election campaign. His two remaining Republican rivals suddenly dropped out of the race last week, anointing him the party's presumptive presidential nominee faster than even the confident candidate expected. As part of his general election planning, Trump told the AP at his office in New York that he's moving aggressively to identify a running mate with deep political experience. While he would not provide a full list of names, he did not rule out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the former rival whom he's already tapped to head his transition planning. FILE - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, accompanied by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, center, and his son Eric Trump, right, Jan. 3, 2016. A first-time political candidate, the celebrity businessman said there's no need for another business person on the Republican ticket and he wants a running mate who can help him pass legislation as president. By joining forces with a political veteran, Trump would also signal a willingness to work with the Republican establishment that he's thoroughly bashed during his campaign. Trump said he doesn't plan to announce his running mate until the Republican National Convention in July, a four-day event that he's planning to remake with a showman's touch. In the interview, Trump outlined a general election campaign that banks heavily on his personal appeal and trademark rallies while spurning the kind of sophisticated data operation that was a centerpiece of Barack Obama's winning White House runs. He also ruled out for the first time the option of taking public financing for his campaign, money that would have saved him the time-consuming task of raising vast sums but would have dramatically limited the amount he would have been able to raise. Trump stunned the political world at every turn during the Republican primary season, prioritizing large rallies over intimate voter interactions in early voting states and operating with a slim campaign operation. Even as he brings in new staff for the general election campaign, he says his emphasis will continue to be on raucous rallies to put him in front of thousands of voters and generate free media coverage. US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greets supporters at his campaign rally at Werner Enterprises Hangar in Omaha, Nebraska, US May 6, 2016. The businessman said he'll spend ``limited'' money on data operations to identify and track potential voters and to model various turnout scenarios that could give him the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. He's moving away from the model Obama used successfully in his 2008 and 2012 wins, and which Clinton is trying to replicate, including hiring many of the staff that worked for Obama. Still, the Republican National Committee has invested heavily in data operations, eager to avoid another defeat to a more technologically savvy Democrat. Trump could make use of that RNC data if he wished. Trump and his aides have been meeting with RNC officials this week to discuss the mechanics of his campaign. He is also planning a trip to Washington Thursday to meet with party leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have had a mixed reaction to his primary success. As Trump was speaking, however, his campaign posted a new ad on Instagram assailing Clinton for her response to the attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\",\n",

Some of those attackers reportedly killed Israeli civilians.

In pursuing the Taliban, Moscow is playing a two-sided diplomatic game, analysts say. FILE - Soviet combat vehicles are seen crossing Soviet-Afghan border as Soviet troops return home from Afghanistan. (AP Photo) Which way does the aid flow? More than two decades after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia has upped its military and economic aid to the Afghan government, which is battling the Taliban in several areas of the country. That aid includes 10,000 Kalashnikov rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition that the government will use to fight both IS and the Taliban insurgency, analysts say. VOA could not confirm the authenticity of the report. But, according to analysts, Russia sees Taliban help as essential in fighting the spillover effects of the IS insurgency in Afghanistan. Durand Line of Afghanistan Battling Islamic State militants Militants from Central Asian nations have been training under IS in the tribal belt along the Durand Line between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to IS video and military intelligence in several nations. Central Asians have also been fighting alongside the Taliban. Some of the militants recently joined IS and may return to their native countries for terror activities, Russian media say. It is not clear whether or not the Taliban has received any military or financial assistance from Russia, but the group has been trying to gain international recognition, according to the Kabul presidential palace adviser. A member of the Afghan security forces walks as smoke billows from a building after a Taliban attack in Gereshk district of Helmand province, Afghanistan, March 9, 2016. Taliban insurgents have increased militant activities in various parts of Afghanistan. The Taliban warned last week that new attacks coming in the new fighting season. According to Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry, around 1,300 foreign militants, most of them members of the Pakistani Taliban, participated in the assault on Kunduz. IS militants in Afghanistan have established a presence in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar and launched multiple attacks on government and Taliban security checkpoints. Recent Afghan and NATO military operations have helped clear many areas in Nangarhar of IS presence. Russian officials say IS fighters in Afghanistan plan to use the country a jumping-off point. But the Taliban have reportedly told Moscow that IS is using Afghanistan mostly as a training ground and, according to analyst Muzhda, the Taliban would not support the spread of terrorist activities into neighboring Central Asian countries.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' Under Kim Jong Un, the country has seen lower numbers of defectors trying to escape to the more prosperous South. North Korea did begin live-fire drills at sea near the border, but they conducted similar drills last year. This may be overly optimistic but the country has experienced positive growth for the past three years. Part of the reason for this decline is that Pyongyang, during the tenure of Kim Jong Un, has increased the number of border guards and instituted harsher punishments for Koreans caught attempting to illegally cross the border. And because it is more difficult and dangerous to escape, it is also more expensive. It can cost thousands of dollars to pay smugglers and bribe border guards, to illegally cross over the border into China. But Andrei Lankov, a professor of North Korea history at Kookmin University in Seoul, also credits the young supreme leader for taking a more practical approach to managing the economy to give more workers a financial incentive to operate within the system. A case in point, he said, is the increase of legal migrant labor programs that send low wage North Korean workers to China, Russia and the Middle East. By allowing these laborers to work overseas, with the caveat that their families would be held accountable if they do not return, Professor Lankov said Kim Jong Un is giving workers a viable alternative to defecting. Human rights groups, like the Seoul-based Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, describe the controls imposed by Pyongyang as inhumane treatment. These migrant workers often toil long hours under harsh conditions and have no legal rights or recourse. Their passports are confiscated and they are allowed to keep only a portion of the wages they earn. Still, these are sought after jobs in North Korea, where workers in many state run operations do not get paid at all. Since the famine that struck North Korea in the late 1990s, when about one million people died of starvation, Pyongyang has slowly instituted some market-based reforms to the state run communist system to allow farmers to keep a portion of what they earn. Under Kim Jong Un some state owned enterprises have been given the latitude to operate essentially as private businesses. Professor Lankov said the economic system now is a ruthless type of capitalism, rife with exploitation, but it is working. Because it is a very brutal type of capitalism there, really brutal. No social security. Nothing. But he says it is important to note the country is not on the verge of starvation or economic collapse. VOA Seoul Producer Youmi Kim contributed to this report.',\n",

Witnesses said the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus denied responsibility. That attack prompted President Donald Trump, on day 77 of his presidency, to dramatically shift U.S. policy on Syria. After the attack, hospitals around Khan Sheikhoun were overwhelmed, and paramedics sent victims to medical facilities across rebel-held areas in northern Syria, as well as to Turkey.

Gulen, a moderate Islamic preacher and Turkish citizen who lives in Pennsylvania legally, is accused by the Turkish government to be the mastermind behind the July 15 coup attempt. Turkey has been seeking Gulen's extradition. Tens of thousands of Turks have been arrested, suspended or fired from their jobs under a state of emergency imposed by the government following that failed coup attempt.

The government announced Tuesday that borders with Syria and Iraq would be considered closed military zones, and that no new refugee camps will be built. Western coalition And, like the 51 U.S. diplomats that last week called for greater military intervention Syria through a leaked internal memo, Krieg said he believes the U.S. needs to take a strong stance against Syrian government forces before it can expect compromise from the Assad regime at the negotiating table. The conflict roughly pits the Syrian Army allied with Iran and Russia against a host of rebel forces allied with the West and the Gulf States. All sides, at least officially, have a mutual foe in Islamic State and the U.S.-lead coalition said it is fighting IS, not Assad. However, critics say further U.S. involvement would escalate the conflict, dumping more weapons into the war zone. The U.S. is not likely to change courses under President Barack Obama, adds St-Pierre from MOSECON, and some politicians in Europe also insist that they are not planning a ground invasion in Syria.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" 7 Japanese Confirmed Killed in Algeria Japan has confirmed that at least seven of its nationals died after they were taken hostage by militants in Algeria. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, late Monday in Tokyo, confirmed what had been feared in recent days - that most of the Japanese engineers unaccounted for at the besieged natural gas complex in the Algerian desert had been killed. A Public Relations staff of JGC Corp answers reporters at its headquarters in Yokohama, in this photo taken by Kyodo, January 16, 2013. Abe says the bodies of seven Japanese engineers were located in an Algerian hospital. He adds that he is at a loss for words when thinking about the family members of those who were killed. Abe says his government will continue working with the international community to fight terrorism. Three more Japanese, who were employees of JGC Corporation, remain missing. Seven other Japanese managed to escape. The prime minister says he has instructed his staff to take all possible measures to locate those who are still unaccounted for. Rescue workers carry the coffin of one of the hostages killed during a hostage crisis in a gas plant at the hospital in In Amenas, January 21, 2013. Algeria's government says at least 37 foreign nationals died after Islamists stormed the natural gas refinery at In Amenas last Wednesday. Besides Japanese employees of the facility, American, British, French, Norwegian, Filipino and Romanian workers also died. Japanese officials say they have unanswered questions about the response taken by Algeria's military. Its forces on Thursday opened fire, saying the kidnappers were attempting to escape with some of the foreign hostages. Algeria says five of the attackers were captured alive Saturday. Undated photo obtained by ANI Mauritanian news agency reportedly shows former Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) emir Mokhtar Belmokhtar speaking at an undisclosed location. Islamist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, in a video posted on the Internet, has claimed responsibility. He says he was acting in the name of al-Qaida and that the attack was conducted, in part, as a response to the French military operation against al-Qaida linked militants in Mali.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" India to Boycott South Asian Regional Summit in Pakistan India announced Tuesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend a regional summit to be held in Islamabad in November because of increasing cross-border attacks in the region. The decision was announced days after Modi said that he will mount a global campaign to diplomatically isolate Pakistan in the wake of a terror attack on an Indian army base in Kashmir that killed 18 soldiers. Tensions between the two countries have spiked after India blamed the attack on Pakistan-based militants. Islamabad has denied any role in the assault, and said it could be a reaction to the situation in Indian Kashmir, which has been wracked with widespread civilian unrest since July. Coffins containing bodies of Indian soldiers G. Doloi and Biaswajit Garai, killed in an attack at the Indian army base in Kashmir, arrive at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport in Kolkata, India, Sept. 19, 2016. Without elaborating, the statement said that other countries have also conveyed their reservations about attending the South Asian gathering. They are believed to be Afghanistan and Bangladesh, which also blame Pakistan for supporting terror groups. Neither country has publicly disclosed such reservations. SAARC includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and the Maldives. She said Pakistan believes terrorist attacks will allow it to gain territory it covets in Kashmir. While New Delhi accuses Pakistan of backing and supporting militant groups that mount terror strikes in India, Islamabad holds India responsible for human rights violations in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory divided between them and claimed by both. About 80 civilians have been killed since July in the largest anti-India protests in recent years. On Tuesday, India also summoned Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit in New Delhi for the second time in less than a week and presented him with what it said was proof of Pakistan's involvement in the militant strike on an Indian army base in Kashmir that killed 18 soldiers. Regional isolation is one among a range of retaliatory measures New Delhi has been weighing against Islamabad. Water exploitation On Thursday, Modi is due to hold a meeting to review the Most Favored Nation status that New Delhi has granted to Pakistan. Indian officials have suggested they are also exploring ways in which New Delhi can increase the exploitation of water from three Himalayan rivers that flow into Pakistan. India has a right to use roughly 20 percent of the water under a 1960 pact, but says it has not done so. New Delhi says there is no plan to scrap the treaty, but it will see how it can utilize more water allowed under its terms. Such a move could further heighten tensions between the two countries. The waters of the three rivers are crucial for Pakistan.\",\n",

Map showing St. Louis, Missouri For weeks after Brown's shooting, demonstrators, sometimes violent, had demanded a reckoning. When a grand jury in late November found insufficient cause to indict Officer Darren Wilson, protests erupted in more than 170 U.S. cities, from Atlanta to New York to Seattle to Washington. Ferguson, Missouri, map shows #1) Ferguson Market and Liquors and #2) Canfield Drive, approximate site where Michael Brown was shot. In March, the U.S. Justice Department announced it would not pursue civil rights charges against the officer. But the department also said a separate investigation into Ferguson showed extensive evidence of a police force operating with extreme racial prejudice and a municipal court system exploiting blacks to generate city revenue. FILE - Angry protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, Aug. 18, 2014. The independent panel's mission is to help chart a path to improve the region's social and economic conditions. The commission recently endorsed more tactical, anti-bias and wellness training for police, and Aldridge said it's looking at measures such as raising the minimum wage and establishing childhood savings accounts to support education. Only 4 percent say they see no problem. Nonwhites are more likely to acknowledge racism as an issue. It polled 2,002 adults July 14-20. A man is detained after a standoff between protesters and police Monday, Aug. 18, 2014. Nationally, African-Americans are arrested at much higher rates than people of other races, USA Today discovered in an analysis of FBI data last year. It found that while blacks in Ferguson were almost three times as likely to be arrested as people of other races, nearly 1,600 other U.S. communities had even higher rates. It urges setting standards for the use of new technology, including the body cameras increasingly worn by officers to document interactions with the public. Also in May, the White House announced it would halt funding of some military-style equipment for law enforcement. Shooting of Michael Brown Johnson said criticism breeds the kind of anti-police sentiment that led a gunman to ambush and fatally shoot New York Police Department Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in their patrol car in December. In Ferguson, Officer Jill Gronewald, who started with the police force just weeks after Brown's death, is trying to build connections within the community. Absolutely.

       " {'content': \" Cambodian Activist Gunned Down in Phnom Penh Prominent Cambodian political activist and commentator Kem Ley was shot dead in broad daylight while sitting in a coffee shop at a gas station in Phnom Penh Sunday. The popular public figure was an outspoken critic of the government and the founder of the Grass Roots Democracy Party. His killing has intensified growing public outrage at the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, with a large crowd of protesters at the scene convinced this was just the latest act in a wave of government intimidation of opposition politicians and civil society ahead of elections next year. An eyewitness, who asked reporters to conceal her identity, said two men walked into the shop where Ley was drinking coffee and shot him in the head repeatedly at point blank range. Police survey the crime scene where Kem Ley was shot dead while family members pray next to his dead body, July 10, 2016. National Police spokesman Kirt Chantarith said a suspect had been arrested who told them he had shot Ley over a debt. It is a $ 3,000 debt. Eventually police relented and hundreds, perhaps thousands of people marched through the streets with his body in a car filled and surrounded by family, heading to Wat Chak pagoda to commence his funeral. Cambodians shout slogans outside a shopping mall where prominent political analyst Kem Ley was shot dead in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, July 10, 2016. Global Witness report on PM Hun Sen The question is why? Kem Ley's wife Pou Rachana weeps as her late husband's body is driven through Phnom Penh on the way to his funeral at Wat Chak pagoda, Cambodia, July 10, 2016. Kem Ley was a charismatic and immensely popular political figure who frequently criticized both the government and the opposition for failing to implement democratic structures within their own parties. He sought to generate greater public participation in politics, but maintained he sought no political ambitions for himself.

(Lim Sothy/VOA Khmer) Government's crackdown In recent months the government has made sweeping arrests of opposition members and outspoken members of civil society, repeatedly threatened the media and launched a sustained attack on deputy opposition leader Kem Sokha. The Cambodia National Rescue Party deputy leader remains holed up in CNRP headquarters trying to avoid a charge related to allegations he engaged in prostitution and corruption by having an extra-marital affair. Cambodians are set to head to local elections next year and a national ballot the following year, having almost voted the ruling party out of its more than three decades in office in 2013.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Pakistan-based Rebel Leader Warns India Over Kashmir Violence The head of a Pakistan-based militant group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir has warned that his followers will storm the cease-fire line that divides the region unless New Delhi ends its current wave of violence against Kashmiris. Syed Salahuddin, commander of the separatist Hizbul Mujahideen, or HuM, issued the warning Thursday while addressing an anti-India rally in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistan-ruled part of the disputed Himalayan region. He reiterated his call for Islamabad to cut all ties to New Delhi. He did not announce a date. Tens of thousands of residents of Indian Kashmir have for weeks defied a strict curfew and security crackdown to attend street protests over the killing of a 22-year-old HuM commander, Burhan Wani, by Indian government forces on July 8. Kashmiri villagers carry body of Burhan Wani, chief of operations of Indian Kashmir's largest rebel group Hizbul Mujahideen, during his funeral procession in Tral, some 38 Kilometers (24 miles) south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, July 9, 2016. Since his death, clashes between stone-throwing Kashmiri youth and Indian security forces firing live ammunition, shotgun pellets and tear gas have left more than 55 civilians and two police officers dead. Thousands of civilians have been injured and hospitals in Kashmir are overwhelmed while scores are threatened with blindness by pellets lodged in their eyes; but, the violence continues to paralyze life in Kashmir. India regards Salahuddin, who also heads an alliance of 15 Kashmiri rebel groups called the United Jihad Council, or UJC, and his group as terrorists and blames Pakistan for fueling the recent unrest. Islamabad denies the charges and maintains it provides moral and political support to Kashmiris. Kashmiri protesters shout pro-freedom slogans during a protest march in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Aug. 11, 2016. Speaking at the weekly news conference in Islamabad Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria responded to the summoning of the Pakistani envoy in India and the confession by an alleged Pakistani national. A military cease-fire line called the Line of Control, or LoC, divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan and both claim the region in its entirety. The dispute has sparked two of the three wars between the two countries and remains at the center of bilateral tensions.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Top Hezbollah Commander Badreddine Killed in Syria The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah buried a top military commander Friday after he was killed in an attack in Syria, where the group has deployed thousands of fighters. Hezbollah fighters carried the coffin of Mustafa Badreddine through the streets of southern Beirut in a funeral procession. Without giving any specific time, Hezbollah said Badreddine was killed in a big explosion targeting one of its bases near Damascus' airport. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing. Investigation Hezbollah said it was investigating the cause of the explosion, saying the probe would determine whether an airstrike, missile attack or artillery bombardment had caused the blast. Top Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine is seen in this handout picture released by Hezbollah Media office on May 13, 2016. Badreddine was a top adviser of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The group has been fighting alongside troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah says the war is necessary to protect Shi'ites from Sunni extremists who have been at the forefront of the Syrian opposition. Hezbollah's deployment of fighters to Syria has increased the group's enemies beyond its traditional rival, Israel, to include Sunni extremists. The U.S. does not have information on who was behind the attack that killed Badreddine, State Department spokesman John Kirby said. No coalition aircraft nearby White House spokesman Josh Earnest said there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft in the area where Badreddine was reported to have been killed. Kirby noted that Badreddine was convicted in Kuwait for his role in bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in 1983. Badreddine escaped from prison in Kuwait after the country was invaded by Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein in 1990. Badreddine was also one of four men accused in absentia of plotting the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. The trial began in 2014 at The Hague, Netherlands, and is ongoing. Hezbollah denied any involvement in the attack. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Badreddine in 2011 and 2015 for his involvement in the Syrian war. According to U.S. officials, Assad and Nasrallah coordinated Hezbollah's actions in Syria on a weekly basis, with Badreddine present at top Damascus meetings. Hezbollah members carry the coffin of top Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine, who was killed in an attack in Syria, during his funeral in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon, May 13, 2016. The group released a picture, showing a smiling Badreddine wearing a camouflage baseball cap. Other deaths There was no official reaction from Israel, which customarily declines to comment on such matters. VOA's Edward Yeranian contributed to this report from Cairo. Women mourn during the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine, who was killed in an attack in Syria, in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon, May 13, 2016. Who was Badreddine?

       " {'content': \" US, British Officials Note Possibility of Terrorism in Sinai Crash Speaking before talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is in London Thursday, Cameron also noted that experts are not yet certain of the cause of the crash. But Russia's government has rejected that theory, saying it is too early to say what caused the plane to crash. Relatives mourn next to a coffin of Alexei Alexeev, a victim of a Russian airliner which crashed in Egypt, during a funeral ceremony at the Bogoslovskoye cemetery in St. Petersburg, Russia, Nov. 5, 2015. An Egyptian presidential spokesman has also cautioned against drawing conclusions yet. Forensic examinations Experts are examining the wreckage for any signs of terrorism, while some reports say forensic examinations have revealed shrapnel in some of the victims. The experts also have retrieved both black box flight recorders. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the disaster, but has so far not presented any firm evidence to back it up. He is in London to meet Thursday with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Trucks carry the bodies of the air crash victims from a city morgue to the crematorium for identification in St.Petersburg, Russia, Nov. 2, 2015. With Britain and Egypt offering vastly different opinions on the cause of the plane crash, the incident is sure to be high on the two leaders' agenda. The meeting at 10 Downing Street was scheduled before the crash took place. Also Thursday, relatives of one of the plane crash victims held the first funeral associated with the crash. Friends and relatives of Nina Lushchenko gathered in the city of Veliky Novgorod, about 160 kilometers south of St. Petersburg, to bury her. Abdel-Wahab Ali, the chief of the Sharm El-Sheikh airport, was promoted Wednesday to become assistant to the chairman of the state company that runs Egypt's civilian airports, according to The Associated Press. It is not clear what effect this would have on his position at the airport. IS allegation Schenker said the extremist group has an interest in attacking both Egypt and Russia, and that blowing up a soft target like a civilian airliner would send a powerful signal. The Metrojet Airbus took off from the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh for St. Petersburg, Russia Saturday and shortly thereafter disappeared from radar. A team of British aviation experts went to the Sharm-El-Sheikh airport to assess security there before any British flights will be allowed to leave the region. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday no U.S. air carriers regularly operate out of the Sinai Peninsula. Several airlines, including Air France, Lufthansa, Dubai-based Emirates and Qatar Airways have stopped flying over the Sinai Peninsula for safety reasons. Fleet suspended The Russian Federal Transport Agency said the airliner Metrojet has suspended all flights of Airbus A321 jets in its fleet since the crash. Authorities said they have not found any evidence of a missile attack at the time the jetliner crashed Saturday. That leaves open the possibility of an explosion aboard the flight, either from a bomb or a mechanical failure. A U.S. military satellite detected a heat flash at the time the jetliner crashed over the Sinai. But no missile launch or missile engine burn was detected. Experts told U.S. media outlets the heat flash could point to a catastrophic event aboard the aircraft, such as an explosion, fire or even just the aircraft parts hitting the ground.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" US Condemns Russia's Arrest of Opposition Leader, Hundreds of Protesters Tens of thousands of Russians demonstrated in cities across the country in support of a call by Navalny for accountability among Russia's elite. OVD-Info, an organization that monitors Russian political repression, said on its website that more than 1,000 people were arrested in the Moscow demonstrations alone. Law enforcement officers gather as they block opposition supporters in Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017. That number has not been independently confirmed and state news agency TASS cited Moscow police as saying they made about 500 arrests, including Navalny. He was detained while walking from a subway station to join the rally at Moscow's iconic Pushkin Square. Reports from the scene say police put him in a truck that was surrounded by hundreds of protesters. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is escorted upon his arrival for a hearing after being detained at the protest against corruption, at the Tverskoi court in Moscow, Russia, March 27, 2017. The protests appear to be the largest coordinated outpouring of dissatisfaction since the massive 2011-2012 demonstrations following a fraud-tainted parliamentary election. A detained woman looks out of a police bus in downtown Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017. Russia's leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny and his supporters aim to hold anti-corruption demonstrations throughout Russia. Navalny, a Kremlin critic, called the demonstrations after his Foundation for Fighting Corruption released a detailed report earlier this month accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of amassing a collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards through a shadowy network of non-profit organizations. The report has been viewed over 11 million times on YouTube. Law enforcement officers detain an opposition supporter during a rally in Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017. There was scant coverage of the demonstrations on Russia's official media. Navalny said on his official website that 99 Russian cities planned to protest, but that in 72 of them local authorities did not give permission. Navalny has been rallying supporters in major Russian cities in recent weeks.\",\n",

Most of the protesters had left the Oceti Sakowin camp before the Wednesday evacuation deadline. On Thursday, officers methodically checked buildings and arrested anyone they encountered, including a man who climbed atop a building and stayed there for more than an hour before surrendering.

Threat of spring flooding prompts deadline The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had set a 2 p.m. Wednesday deadline for the camp to be cleared, citing the threat of spring flooding. Native Americans and environmental activists have lived at the camp since August fighting construction of the pipeline, which they say threatens the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's water resources and disregards the land's sacred status.

It is designed to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to Illinois. The protests have been led by Native American tribes, particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux, whose reservations are downstream from the construction site.

When Nigerians need to get themselves or their possessions around, they mostly turn to buses, trucks and cars, but those can be unreliable in a country that suffers from decrepit roads and intermittent fuel shortages. The issue has been whether the train will be reliable. It is now reliable. Is it available? Cattle are offloaded from a freight train at the Oko-Oba abattoir in Lagos, Nigeria, Sept. 3, 2016. (C. Stein/VOA) Train tracks crisscross Nigeria, most of which were built by British colonizers. They fell into disrepair in the decades since Nigeria gained independence in 1960. While some roads in Nigeria are well paved, many of its major trade routes are filled with potholes, or lined with security checkpoints that some travelers say are just avenues for bribe-taking by local officials. Nigeria has tried many times to get its railways in order. Cattle are pictured after being offloaded from a train at the Oko-Oba abattoir in Lagos, Nigeria, Sept. 3, 2016. (C. Stein/VOA) This year, a new rail line linking the capital Abuja to the city of Kaduna opened. But those efforts are for moving people. Sulyman Dauda says Oko-Oba relies on a stream of trucks to supply cattle. But that flow is unreliable, and often brings in cows that are injured from the hours on the road. This has caused conflicts with farmers, who accuse herdsmen of trampling their crops. Dozens of people have been killed in clashes between farmers and herdsmen across the country this year. Encouraging the transportation of cattle by rail is meant to help solve these problems. Cattle are offloaded from a freight train at the Oko-Oba abattoir in Lagos, Nigeria, Sept. 3, 2016. (C. Stein/VOA) Oko-Oba lacks a formal platform for unloading animals, so the cows were led off the train cars on wooden planks. Crowds gathered around the train in a field of mud and broken pieces of wood and plastic, the remnants of shacks that had recently been demolished to make room along the railroad tracks. Cattle dealer Tahir Jibrin Kabir said the cows he inspected were in better shape than those brought in by truck. Alli said the train would make its return journey filled with fertilizer. He expects it to return every week to Lagos with more cattle.',\n",

The destruction of the city is extensive. There are no clear reports of how many IS militants and how many Iraqi security forces died or were wounded in the battle for the city. A member of the Iraqi security forces holds an Islamic State flag, after pulling it down from a building, in Fallujah, Iraq, June 25, 2016. Tens of thousands need aid Afraid of dying in the crossfire, 85,000 people have flooded out of the city and surrounding areas, overwhelming humanitarian agencies and Iraqi government efforts to help them. Many of the displaced are without adequate shelter, living under searing summer temperatures of 45 degrees or higher and punishing sandstorms. Displaced Iraqis who fled the government's operation against the Islamic State (IS) group in the city of Fallujah carry basic food items donated by a NGO called Preemptive Love Coalition on June 20, 2016 in a camp in Khaldiyeh. The director of a health center in Amariyat al-Fallujah, where many of the displaced ran to, warned of the lack of water and sanitation. Situation unstable But despite the dire conditions in the camps, Muflahi cautioned against having civilians return to their homes too soon. Displaced Iraqis from Fallujah are seen at a camp in Amiriyiah al-Fallujah, some 30 kms south of from the embattled city, June 20, 2016. Many of the displaced are women and children. All males over the age of 14 were separated from their families upon leaving Fallujah to undergo security screening to make sure they were not IS members. Those released are given special badges to identify them. The screening procedure is supposed to be conducted solely by Iraqi Security Forces. Iraqi Prime Minster Haider al-Abadi on Friday had already declared victory over the IS militants. Mosul next The next step, Abadi said, would be to retake Mosul.

The UNHCR is already working to build a camp to house some 6,000 future displaced on land donated by the Governor of Irbil. But it is a drop in the bucket, and nearby camps of those fleeing the ongoing fighting outside Mosul are already full.\",\n",

Fortin also cited the ease of getting a working visa in Vietnam. A screen grab of Tropical MBA's website. He was living and working in Calgary, Canada, when he realized he needed a change. Community workspaces Opportunities for specifically tech nomad expatriates are booming in the economic center of Vietnam, where many small community workspaces have popped up. One such place, Start Saigon, caters to foreigners in the heart of popular District 1 in Ho Chi Minh City. The space attracts members from all around the world, staying open 24/7 for those working on American or European time, or long hours in general. It also boasts optical fiber Internet in every room, and an onsite pool for a quick (or not so quick) break during the workday. Fortin, like many others, quickly found the benefits of living in Vietnam stretched beyond practical ease. Community centers and specific coffee shops in Ho Chi Minh City attract a specific clientele, and because most expats are conducting business abroad, they are often slow to learn the language and assimilate, if they do at all. FILE - Three young Vietnamese girls go online at a cafe in Hanoi, Vietnam, May 14, 2013. He also said he found that expats were treated very differently and were well-respected, while relations between citizens were often less friendly. He cited competition between the Vietnamese as a reason they were friendlier toward him than each other, saying that he thinks the lack of job opportunities in Vietnam leads to a more driven and aggressive youth. Returned to US After a successful two years in Ho Chi Minh City, Fortin has recently left the tech nomad paradise for greyer skies. The nomad life, however, is not far from his mind. Fortin has not yet subscribed to an American phone because he is sure that, soon enough, he will be taking his laptop abroad again.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' Attack Against Police in Kenya Highlights Rising Threat of Female Extremism In September, three people attacked a police station in Mombasa, Kenya. They stabbed one police officer and set fire to the building before being shot dead, according to Kenyan police. The incident drew international attention, not only for the brazenness of the attack, but for the gender of the attackers: all three were women. Experts say female extremism is on the rise in Kenya and across the continent, as terror groups look for recruits who are less likely to elicit suspicion and can move through cities and checkpoints without being searched by police. The results are deadly. For instance, in northeast Nigeria and Cameroon between June 2014 and April 2016, officials recorded more than 200 female suicide bombers killed more than 1,000 people. Phyllis Muema is the executive director of the Kenya Community Support Center based in Mombasa that works with young people and their families at risk of being indoctrinated by violent extremist groups. Muema said she has noticed in the past year that extremist groups are focusing more attention on recruiting women. FILE - Masked Spanish police officers lead a detained woman in Melilla, Dec. 16, 2014. Islamic State has deployed female suicide bombers around the world, including 10 would-be suicide bombers arrested in October in Morocco. They were said to be planning attacks on tourist sites. An IS affiliate claimed responsibility for the Mombasa attack, according to media reports. But the question remains: Why would women join a group whose ideology states they should be subservient to men and tells them they do not deserve equal rights? Muema said many girls in coastal Kenya have no job opportunities and are desperate. Extremist groups such as IS offer them the ability to have a leadership role. FILE - Children stand near the scene of an explosion a day after two female suicide bombers targeted a busy marketplace in Potiskum, Nigeria, Jan. 12, 2015. Muema said the Mombasa attack was particularly stunning because the perpetrators were local students who had graduated with high grades. Fredrick Ogenga, founding director of the Center for Media, Democracy, Peace and Security at Rongo University in Kenya, recently completed a study examining female extremism in Kenya while serving as a Southern Voices Network for Peacebuilding scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. He found that they come to the ideology willingly. FILE - Rescue workers transport a victim of a suicide bomb attack at a refugee for treatment at a hospital in Maiduguri, Nigeria, Feb. 10, 2016. Two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in a northeast Nigerian refugee camp, killing dozens of people. You are seeing women willingly subscribing to the idea of jihadi bride-ism. Fears of escalation Ogenga went on to warn that incidents like the one in Mombasa are harbingers of what is yet to emerge in Kenya. He also said the media needs to do a better job of informing the public, while not sensationalizing or glorifying acts of terror.',\n",

       " {'content': \" From just 100 members a year ago, the so-called Yunarmiya Patriotic Movement has grown to more than 30,000, aged between 11 and 18. Analysts say Yunarmiya is the Kremlin's latest effort to encourage support from Russia's next generation. Its debut comes just weeks after nationwide anti-corruption protests that had a large turnout of Russian youth. The unauthorized protests on March 26 surprised many with their defiance, scale, and quantity of students. Russia's military-patriotic movement Yunarmiya cadets march during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade at Red Square in Moscow, May 7, 2017. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for the demonstrations after his anti-corruption group released an investigation online alleging Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was hiding enormous wealth. Medvedev gave no initial response to the allegations, but later dismissed them as fantasy. Despite minimal coverage in the dominant state media, tens of thousands took part and hundreds were detained in Moscow, including 20-year-old political science major David-Viktor Ratkin. Luring the young away from protest movements The Kremlin has backed numerous efforts to encourage support and loyalty among Russian youth. FILE - Police detain a protester in downtown Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017. The threat of a rising protest movement in Russia has been a driving force behind the creation of patriotic programs for young people. Pro-Kremlin groups have been reaching out online to Russian youth with anti-Western propaganda. But Putin's Youth Army raises concerns that authorities are looking to militarize a generation of nationalists. Students posted videos in late March of them challenging teachers who warn pupils not to join opposition protests or complain about corruption. Putin has been in power nearly 17 years and is widely expected to run for president again in 2018 with few real challengers. Navalny announced his campaign for president in late 2016, but a Russian court ruling last week upholding an embezzlement conviction could stop him from standing for election. Navalny wants to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Russian military cadets hold a giant replica of the Soviet flag as part of preparations for Victory Day, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 5, 2017. There are concerns that by involving youth in organizations like Yunarmiya, Russian authorities are looking to militarize a new generation of nationalists. Russian authorities apparently do not want to take any chances. Ricardo Marquina Montanana contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Egyptian Police Fire Teargas at Student Protesters Egyptian police fired teargas at protesting students at Cairo's al-Azhar university on Wednesday hours after authorities announced the detention of Muslim Brotherhood leader Essam El-Erian, part of a crackdown against the Islamist movement. Students at the country's top institution for Islamic teachings have been demonstrating for weeks in support of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, whom the army toppled in July after mass protests against his rule. Student supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi carry a comrade injured during clashes with Egyptian security forces outside Al-Azhar university in Cairo on October 28, 2013. Demonstrations at Al-Azhar are a sensitive matter because the institution has historically toed the government line. Erian, the deputy leader of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, was taken into custody early on Wednesday from a residence in New Cairo where he had been in hiding. Local media circulated a photo of what they described as the moment he was arrested, showing a smiling Erian standing next to a bed with two packed duffle bags. Senior members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, right, and Essam el-Erian hold a press conference on the latest situation in Egypt in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2011. (AP Photo/ Mohammed Abou Zaid) Many Brotherhood leaders have been detained since the army deposed Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, and declared a road map leading to elections. Morsi, Erian and 12 other Brotherhood leaders are expected to go on trial on Monday on charges of inciting violence. The charges relate to the deaths of about a dozen people in clashes outside the presidential palace last December after Morsi enraged protesters with a decree expanding his powers. The trial of three senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders on charges of inciting violence was halted on Tuesday after the judge withdrew from the case for unexplained reasons. The trials are likely to create more political upheaval in Egypt, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route. The Brotherhood, which demands Morsi's reinstatement, accuses the army of staging a coup that sabotaged democratic gains made since a popular uprising toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. A man looks at bodies laid out in a make shift morgue after Egyptian security forces stormed two huge protest camps at the Rabaa al-Adawiya and Al-Nahda squares where supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi were camped, in Cairo, on August 14, 2013. At least 1,000 people, including members of the security forces, were killed in the violence that followed Morsi's overthrow. Hundreds of Morsi supporters were killed when police forces stormed two protest camps on Aug. 14. An Egyptian court in September banned the Muslim Brotherhood group and seized their funds to try to crush the movement, which the government accuses of inciting violence and terrorism. The Brotherhood's discipline and hierarchy helped it win elections after the revolt that toppled Mubarak, eventually propelling Morsi into power. Now the army-led government and its supporters regard the Brotherhood as a terrorist group and enemy of the state. The security forces and police, feared and despised under Mubarak, are lauded for cracking down on the organization. The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful protest. But as members go into hiding, its key building blocks - local groups of seven members known as usras - are under pressure. Critics of the government say it is becoming more authoritarian, stifling dissent and limiting freedom of speech. Human rights groups and some liberal politicians have expressed alarm over a draft law under debate that would place severe restrictions on protests. New York-based Human Rights Watch said the law would give police carte blanche to ban protests in Egypt.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Sanctuary Churches in US Mobilize to Help Undocumented More than 800 churches and some synagogues have declared themselves sanctuaries and are taking other measures to stop the deportation of immigrants who are in the country illegally. As a candidate, Trump vowed to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and stepping up deportations of those already here, focusing particularly on those with criminal records. Since he took office, he has issued three executive orders on immigration, including one that opens the door to deporting almost anyone without documentation. All Souls Senior Minister Reverend Robert Hardies says his congregation is motivated to protect undocumented immigrants in the community. FILE - Ingrid Encalada Latorre walks with her year-old son, Anibal, where she is taking sanctuary at a Denver Quaker center, the Mountain View Friends Meeting, a small, two-story brick structure just blocks from the University of Denver, in Denver. All Souls and other American churches provided sanctuary during the 1980s for Central American refugees fleeing the wars and massacres in the region. Earlier, during the Vietnam War, American churches offered sanctuary to those who refused to serve in the military. Bishop Dwayne Royster, political director of PICO, a national network of faith-based community organizations, notes the idea of sanctuary goes even further back in American history. FILE - A photo released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows a foreign national being arrested during a targeted enforcement operation conducted by ICE agents, Feb. 7, 2017. The exact number of undocumented immigrants now in sanctuary is unknown, in large part because those involved want to keep the cases private. However, there has been publicity surrounding a few cases of unauthorized immigrants taking refuge in churches, including in Denver and Philadelphia. VOA recently reported on two undocumented immigrants, currently living in a Phoenix, Arizona, church. A Honduran woman under threat of deportation this month sought refuge at a Quaker Meeting House in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The 59-year-old woman, who goes by the name of Emma, arrived in the 1990s and has a traffic citation but no criminal record, according to her attorney. Emma, standing behind speaker to the left, is seeking sanctuary in Albuquerque, New Mexico. For now, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is following its practice of not entering churches to arrest those living there. The policy was confirmed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week in a closed door meeting with congressional Democrats, according to the Washington Post. In the 1980s, some pastors and activists providing sanctuary were prosecuted and convicted of conspiracy for smuggling illegal immigrants. All Souls' Hardies says he is consulting with lawyers but is not overly concerned. (Photo courtesy Philly.com) Aside from offering shelter to the undocumented, All Souls is mobilizing volunteers and training them to take action to prevent people in immigrant communities from being deported. Rapid Response teams have been formed to alert communities when ICE agents are in the area or to accompany those picked up to immigration courts. Other groups canvass immigrant neighborhoods letting people know they have certain rights even if they are in the country illegally, including the right to stay silent and to demand a lawyer. Jeanette Vizguerra, left, a Mexican woman seeking to avoid deportation from the United States, cradles her 6-year-old daughter, Zuri, during a news conference in a church in which she and her children have taken refuge, Feb. 15, 2017, in Denver. Keeping families together While the number of congregations offering sanctuary more than doubled since the November election, the more than 800 places of worship offering refuge are just a fraction of the 350,000 religious congregations estimated to exist in the U.S. by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. At pro-Trump rallies earlier this month, demonstrators expressed support for stepped up enforcement measures to deport illegal immigrants, no matter what the costs.\",\n",

In Kyiv, meanwhile, prosecutors have opened a treason case against the newly-appointed head of Ukraine's Black Sea fleet, after he renounced his post and swore allegiance to pro-Russian leaders in Crimea. Authorities said Admiral Denys Berezovsky, appointed Saturday, offered no resistance later in the day when his headquarters in Sevastopol were surrounded by Russian troops. While the events in Crimea have as yet proved bloodless, fears are rising that in eastern Ukraine, with sizable factions both pro- and anti-Russian, any movement of Russian troops would provoke a far more inflammatory reaction. NATO warning NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Ramussen warned Moscow on Sunday it was threatening peace in Europe with its seizure of Crimea. He said NATO supports the right of the Ukrainian people to determine their future. Ukraine withdrew its coast guard vessels from two ports in Crimea and moved them to other Black Sea bases on Sunday. Ukraine's border guard said in a statement that vessels from the Crimean ports of Kerch and Sevastopol had been moved to Odessa and Mariupol. The situation on Ukraine's frontiers was stable apart from in Crimea, the statement said. Putin has declared he has the right to invade Ukraine to protect Russian citizens. Russian forces have seized Crimea, where they have a naval base at Sevastopol, but have not entered other parts of Ukraine. On Saturday President Obama said the United States is suspending participation in meetings to prepare for the G8 economic summit later this year in Sochi, Russia. Obama said the appropriate way to address this matter is by direct engagement with the Ukrainian government and through international monitors.

The Pentagon says Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu Saturday. Officials say Hagel told Shoygu that without a change on the ground, Russia is risking more regional instability, global isolation, and an escalation that would threaten European and international security. NATO ambassadors met Sunday in Brussels to discuss Ukraine. A meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission was also scheduled. Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev pauses during a news conference following an U.N. Security Council meeting on his country's political crisis, Saturday, March 1, 2014, in the United Nations headquarters. Ukrainian Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev told the Security Council that 15,000 Russian troops are already in Crimea under the pretense of protecting Russian citizens. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin blamed the West for ratcheting up tensions in Ukraine and backing protests that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych last month. Russia has said its troop movements in Crimea, where it leases a naval base in Sevastopol, conform to agreements with Ukraine. Crimea is a Black Sea peninsula placed under Ukrainian control in 1954 by then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. It became part of Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Crimea has a tiny border with Russia on its far eastern point. Most of the people living in Crimea are ethnic Russians, but the region also is home to ethnic Muslim Tartars who generally show disdain toward Russia. Rallies in Russia Police officers detain a protester in central Manezhnaya Square in Moscow, on March 2, 2014, during an unsanctioned rally against the Russia's military actions in Crimea. Smaller anti-war demonstrations took place in both cities, resulting in about 300 arrests. Russian state news agency reported that a referendum scheduled for March 30 in Crimea will give voters the choice of: independence, continued autonomy within Ukraine, or annexation by Russia. Under this legislation, local referendums would trump international treaties. VOA's Scott Stearns contributed to this report from Washington.

Security teams were out in force nationwide after at least three people were fatally shot Wednesday, as tens of thousands of pro- and anti-government factions took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations in decades. Among the victims were a 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old woman, both shot in the head in separate incidents. A National Guard soldier also reportedly was killed in protests in Miranda state, near Caracas. Wednesday's deaths bring the number of people killed in almost three weeks of escalating protests to eight. In recent protests, security forces have fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons.

He announced plans to expand the militia to half a million from its current strength of 100,000 and to arm them with rifles.

Counter march Maduro had rallied his supporters to turn out for a counter march Wednesday, and thousands showed up wearing the red clothing that marked them as Chavistas. Chavez launched the leftist movement carried on by Maduro, who succeeded him as president in 2013. The demonstrations erupted after the Venezuelan Supreme Court's March 30 announcement that it would strip the opposition controlled National Assembly of its legislative powers. The court, stacked with appointees of Maduro and Chavez, reversed its position in the wake of domestic and international outcries about an attempted power grab. The National Socialist Party has ruled Venezuela for 17 years. Economic pressures have mounted in recent years, especially since the price of oil, Venezuela's chief export, began falling in 2014. Venezuelans face chronic, severe shortages of food, medicine and other basics in what once was Latin America's wealthiest country.

Unique emerging market MSCI listing is expected to not just enlarge the scope of QFII program, but also lead to relaxation in controls on foreign investments. Earlier, MSCI had estimated that inclusion in its Emerging Markets Index could draw $400 billion into Chinese shares in the next decade. But some analysts believe this kind of inflow is possible in five years because of the large number of Chinese companies are planning to list in exchanges in New York, London and Hong Kong in the coming years.

It opposed a 20 percent limit China has imposed on foreign investors for repatriating their investments and profits during share sell-offs. The index maker also expressed concern over the Chinese system that allows local exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen to impose pre-approval restrictions on launching financial products.

       " {'content': \" Thailand Charges Journalists for Human Trafficking Report Two journalists in Thailand are facing criminal charges for publishing a story about Thai security forces' alleged involvement in trafficking Rohingya Muslims from Burma. The story was originally produced by the Reuters news agency, which this week won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for its coverage of the Rohingya issue. Thai reporter Chutima Sidasathian and Australian editor Alan Morison face charges brought by the Royal Thai Navy for criminal defamation and breaches of Thailand's tough Computer Crimes Act. The two have long reported on the plight of the Rohingya for the online Phuketwan news service. Morison, a former newspaper editor in Melbourne, Australia, established the website more than five years ago. Morison said the charges are questionable and appear targeted at Chutima who had assisted Reuters journalists and other reporters on the story. FILE - Volunteers and police board vehicles before proceeding to Rohingya refugee camps to collect data for the census in Sittwe, March 31, 2014. Outbreaks of ethnic conflict in Burma in recent years have led to thousands of Rohingya, an ethnic minority who are denied citizenship in Burma, to flee the country, often by boat. The report alleged Thai naval forces and police cooperate with human traffickers to send Rohingya to primitive jungle camps until their families can pay a ransom. While praising Reuters on its award, he said the news agency had failed to provide support to Phuketwan in the case. The London-based Reuters has made no comment on the charges against the two journalists. The Royal Thai Navy has not taken action against Reuters. Morison blames a mistranslation into Thai of the English language report published in Phuketwan, and said the Royal Thai Navy's legal action is a bid to close the website down because of its coverage of the Rohingya and human trafficking over several years. Both reporters have received widespread support, including the International Commission of Jurists and U.N. rights groups and Thailand's own Human Rights commission. Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said the Royal Thai navy appears to be seeking to pressure Phuketwan. Both Morison and Chutima face five years in prison for computer crimes charges, and two years in prison for defamation charges. On the 2014 Reporters without Borders World Press Freedom Index Thailand is ranked 130 on a list of 180 countries.\",\n",

The meeting was called in response to events last week that have many Americans concerned. Two black men were shot by white police officers at point-blank range in the states of Louisiana and Minnesota; five white police officers were then shot at a rally in Texas protesting against those shootings, by a black gunman who said he wanted to kill white people. After the White House meeting, which went on much longer than planned, the president said the good news is that progress has been made in many police departments across the country. There is no doubt that minority communities - communities of color - feel it just takes too long to do what's right.

Protestor Ieshia Evans is detained by law enforcement near the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, July 9, 2016. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the conversation on race was extremely urgent, and that although not everyone agreed on everything, the activists, police officers and elected officials present were able to re-establish a sense of common humanity. Several participants spoke of a breakthrough moment, saying every single person had a chance to speak, and people felt like they were truly being heard by those normally on the opposite side of the divisive issue of race and law enforcement. Mayor Garcetti said a breakthrough moment for him was when one of the Black Lives Matter activists turned to a police officer and told him he was sorry for the loss of five police officers shot in Dallas last week by a sniper. The conversation on race took place on the same day funerals were held in Dallas for three of the five police officers killed last week. In the U.S. Senate, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas introduced legislation that would make it a federal crime to kill a police officer. That means you.

       " {'content': \" US-backed Iraqi Forces Take Control of Mosul Airport, Enter City Iraq military officials say their U.S.-backed forces have retaken the airport in Mosul that had been controlled by the extremist Islamic State group since 2014. Officials said Friday the military has also now retaken a sprawling military base next to the airport, and have entered a Mosul neighborhood for the first time in months. Iraqi Lieutenant General Raid Shakir Jaudat said Baghdad's forces, backed by drones and heavy artillery, had advanced on the airport from several positions. At first, accounts of the airport takeover said there was little Islamic State resistance, but later there were reports of Iraqi firefights with militants encamped in airport buildings. Video size width x height pixels IS Flees Mosul Airport Share this video 0:00:43 ▶ 0:00:00 /0:00:43 ▶ ▶ Direct link 270p | 2.0MB 360p | 3.3MB 720p | 18.6MB One Iraqi special forces officer reported IS fighters had targeted Baghdad's fighters with a suicide car bomb and dozens of bombs dropped from drones. The officer said there were at least a dozen casualties, although many were light injuries. An Iraqi takeover of the airport would give its troops access to the city from the southwest and for the first time control of an area along the west bank of the Tigris River. Iraqi security officers place a suspected Islamic State group member into the back of a waiting pickup truck, in east Mosul, Feb. 21, 2017. Little was left inside the airport, and what was once a runway was littered with dirt and debris. IS forces had leveled other buildings in the airport complex. The Iraqi forces also seized an IS weapons storage warehouse, as well its onetime headquarters and barracks. But the advance to retake the remainder of western Mosul may take some time. It took three months for Iraqi forces to seize control of the eastern part of the city. International relations professor Houchang Hassan-Yari of the Royal Military College of Canada told VOA's Persian service that the concentration of civilians in western Mosul would make it harder for Iraqi government forces and their coalition allies to retake that part of the city. Damascus and Moscow have denied targeting civilians in Aleppo. U.S. on front lines U.S. forces have played a key role in the advance of Baghdad's troops, launching airstrikes and providing advisers on the ground. On Thursday, U.S. forces were seen on the front lines of the attack. Iraqi security forces search a civilian in the city of Mosul. Security forces search the liberated eastern part of the city for suspected Islamic State group members still living in the town, Feb. 21, 2017. The American forces are not supposed to be engaged in the fighting under Washington's terms of the U.S. involvement in Iraq. But a coalition spokesman, Air Force Colonel John Dorrian, said Wednesday that in recent weeks they have gotten so close to the front that they have come under attack near Mosul and returned fire. Thousands of Iraqi forces have been involved in the advance on Mosul, while U.S. officials say they think that only about 2,000 jihadists remain in the city. But the fight for control of densely populated western Mosul is likely to be fierce. It includes the Old City and its narrow streets, which are impassable for some military vehicles. Residents of western Mosul report that food supplies are dwindling, but residents on the liberated eastern side of the city are expressing their support. In Photos: US-backed Iraqi Forces Retake Mosul Airport On Wednesday, an army plane dropped thousands of letters from residents of the retaken eastern side into the western area. Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Iraq and vowed that the U.S. would support Iraq in its fight against IS jihadists. There are an estimated 750,000 civilians in western Mosul, essentially under siege by Iraqi forces, along with IS fighters. Many of those civilians in western Mosul were forced out of the eastern part of the city during heavy fighting there last month. Meanwhile, aid agencies are worried and preparing for the possibility that up to 250,000 people might flee Mosul in the coming days or weeks. The U.N. refugee agency has said it is focusing its efforts on building new camps to house the displaced. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has completed eight camps and says it is planning to start work at another site south of Mosul.

A new round of peace talks to settle the Ukraine conflict will be held Wednesday in Berlin, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. The foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany will participate. According to Steinmeier, the request for a meeting came from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin.

More than 100 people, mostly demonstrators, were killed during the rallies. Protest leaders allege that Yanukovych gave the order to security forces to use lethal force against demonstrators. He is also accused of abuse of power and corruption. Both are seen as part of efforts by Russia to destabilize Ukraine, now under a new pro-Western leadership. Moscow denies the charge.

Ukraine, whose economy has been pushed close to bankruptcy by the ongoing conflict in its east, depends on outside assistance as it faces a budget shorfall and huge debt repayments. Cooperation with the IMF is fruitful. I feel optimism about the possible outcome,'' the first deputy head of Ukraine's Central Bank, Oleksander Pisaruk, told journalists Tuesday. Kyiv has already received two tranches worth $4.6 billion. Negotiations on the third tranche are expected to last until the end of the month.\",\n",

As part of the deal, Washington agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in offshore processing camps on Pacific islands in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. In return, Australia would resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The call had been scheduled to last an hour, but the Post said Trump cut it short after 25 minutes when Turnbull tried to turn to other subjects, such as Syria.

Turnbull has no comment Turnbull would not comment on the contents of the call other than to say he believed the resettlement deal remained in place. The Washington Post report received almost blanket coverage in Australian media and was widely seen as embarrassing for Turnbull, whose conservative Liberal-National coalition has only a razor-thin majority after an inconclusive election last year. The resettlement deal was thrown into confusion after Trump signed an executive order last week that suspended the U.S. refugee program and restricted entry to the United States for travelers from majority-Muslim countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria. Many of those being held in the Australian detention center, which have drawn harsh criticism from the United Nations and rights groups, have fled violence in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran.

       " {'content': \" Activists: Syrian Government Shelling Leaves 90 Dead Syrian opposition forces say more than 90 people, many of them children, have been killed in a coordinated assault on a village outside the city of Homs by government artillery and militiamen. Amateur video Handout photo released by Syrian opposition's Shaam News Network shows UN observers at hospital morgue before their burial in central Syrian town of Houla on May 26, 2012. Amateur video shows families burying the dead from Friday's massacre between several long rows of cinder blocks. As elsewhere in Syria, emotions in the cluster of towns that make up Houla are running high. Witnesses say the killing began when government forces shelled the village of Teldau soon after Friday prayers. A woman resident of Teldau claims on a video distributed by opposition forces that she and her daughters-in-law managed to escape the village after it came under attack from militiamen who destroyed part of her house. But she says several other relatives were slaughtered by security forces dressed in black, who killed them with knives. Observers Video of UN Observers in Syria The acting head of the opposition Syrian National Council urged the U.N. Security Council to hold an emergency session to discuss the brutality. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N.-Arab League envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan, condemned the violence. Responsibility Thousands of mourners turned out Saturday in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, to protest the killings. Large student protests have roiled the city in recent days, after months of relative quiet compared to the rest of the country. Other attacks Anti-Syrian regime mourners chant slogans as they carry the body of soldier Khaled Shurbajy, who was shot by Syrian security forces in Dir el Zour last week after disobeying orders to fire on anti-Assad protesters, May 26, 2012 In the Qaddam district of Damascus, government security forces opened fire on mourners, causing a large crowd to scatter in all directions. It was not immediately clear if there were victims. Hilal Khashan, who teaches political science at the American University of Beirut, says he doubts the killings in Houla will provoke serious international outrage, since the world has grown weary of the conflict. Still, he sees the killings as a sign that the Assad government is slowly collapsing. Cease-fire The killings in Houla strike another blow at a cease-fire brokered by Kofi Annan. Close to 300 U.N. monitors are on the ground in Syria to observe the cease-fire which began on April 12, but violence is picking up again, after an initial lull.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Divisions, Harsh Realities Plague Obama's Afghan Surge When President Obama took office six years ago, among the many burdens he inherited were two costly and complex wars: Iraq and Afghanistan. Just this week, Obama was reminded of the grim realities of 13 years of military engagement when a man dressed as an Afghan soldier killed a two-star American general, the highest ranking officer killed in combat since 1970, according to the Pentagon. Afghan workers build a combat resupply area while a Chinook CH-47F transport helicopter prepares to land at FOB Salerno, Afghanistan on December 2, 2009. Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based senior analyst with The International Crisis Group and a former journalist, said there is a clear trend that insurgents are making gains in remote parts of Afghanistan. Case in point: Marjah, a district in southern Helmand province, long a Taliban stronghold, that was cleared in 2010 by NATO and Afghan troops. The situation on the ground has not deterred Obama from pursuing his endgame. In May, he said all American combat troops will leave at the end of this year. Bush and 9/11 President George W. Bush, accompanied by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (L), speaks in front of the west side of the Pentagon on September 12, 2001. It was the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington September 11, 2001 that got the United States in Afghanistan to start with. Bush continued his policy of counterterrorism military operations in Afghanistan, but soon turned his attention towards Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein as the number one national security threat against the United States. A new strategy was needed. It was announced just two months after Obama took office in 2009. The overhaul of the Afghan war was dubbed Af-Pak. The Pak referred to Pakistan, reflecting the idea that success in Afghanistan could not be achieved without a stable Pakistan. And that, went the thinking, would require a far deeper American engagement in Pakistan. To implement the new strategy, Holbrooke was named the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) , but the status of his portfolio was somewhat ambiguous. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan, listens to a question during a news conference in Islamabad June 19, 2010. Nonetheless, the legendary diplomat and his team of experts began their work with a sense of mission and of history making. Singh, currently the Vice President for National Security and International Policy at Center for American Progress, said that idea was the bottom line for their work. In addition to SRAP, Obama turned to senior military officials to get a clear picture of the situation on the ground. He asked then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to assess U.S. military needs and recommend how many more troops should be deployed. President Barack Obama speaks as then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (L) listens during a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House on June 22, 2010. And that singular focus, critics say, set up the entire process to fail. The disillusionment eventually became public when Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor to Holbrooke and now the dean of SAIS at Johns Hopkins University, published his book The Dispensable Nation: American Foreign Policy in Retreat. It also accused White House staffers of undermining Holbrooke, and severely weakening American diplomacy. Obama chose to split the difference of what his military commanders pitched. It was a painful process, according to Gates, who describes a deeply divided administration in his book Duty: A Memoir of a Secretary at War, published earlier this year. Legacy But what is unusual about this president is his discipline, he said. President Barack Obama arrives for a commencement ceremony at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, May 28, 2014. But there is wide concern that time is running out for U.S. moves in Afghanistan. Biddle said the situation is made worse by the fact the war we now have in Afghanistan is a stalemate militarily. And to simply maintain the status quo as U.S. troops drawdown, the Afghan National Security Forces will need continuous financial backing, the kind of which only the U.S. Congress can provide. And that, said Biddle, will not continue indefinitely. Further, not having a political deal in place as the clock winds down worries observers. Singh, who was front and center in the Af-Pak effort, frets about the future of Afghanistan. The recent Afghan presidential elections are cause for hope he said, pointing out that the first round went far better than expected. The second round has been compromised by allegations of fraud and a yet to be resolved dispute between the top two candidates. For his part, the president seems intent on staying the course.\",\n",

Defense lawyers have argued neighbors were actually hearing Pistorius scream in a high-pitched voice. Pistorius has acknowledged killing Steenkamp, but says he thought he was shooting at an intruder through a bathroom door. Prosecutors say the shooting was deliberate.

       " {'content': \" Afghan Court Overturns Death Sentences in Mob Killing of Woman An appeals court in Afghanistan has quietly overturned the death sentence given to four men involved in the brutal mob killing of a woman earlier this year. Fazal Manan Nuri, the defense attorney of one of the accused, Abdul Bashir, told VOA that three of the men convicted of the March murder of Farkhunda Malikzada were instead given 20-year sentences. The fourth convict was sentenced to 10 years because of his age. He was 17 years old at the time of the crime. The decision, Nuri said, was handed down Tuesday. FILE - Afghan women's rights activists carry the coffin of Farkhunda, an Afghan woman who was beaten to death and set alight on fire March 19, during her funeral ceremony in Kabul, March 22, 2015. The decision was kept quiet until a local TV channel, Tolo News, reported the verdict Wednesday based on anonymous sources. Details of the ruling have not been formally announced. Family outraged The secrecy with which the appeals process was handled was the opposite of the trial, during which journalists and news cameras were allowed into the courtroom. Farkhunda, 27, was killed March 19 in a brutal attack that was sparked by false accusations that she desecrated the Muslim holy book, the Quran. Cellphone video showed people beating her with sticks, pushing her body from a rooftop and running it over with a car, before dragging it through the streets of Kabul, burning it, and dumping it in a river. The father of Farkhunda speaks at a hearing at the Primary Court in Kabul, Afghanistan, Wednesday, May 6, 2015. The attack sparked protests in Afghanistan and widespread outrage elsewhere, including condemnations by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the United Nations. Afghan authorities promised swift justice. Thirty civilians and 19 police officers were arrested and charged with either participating in the attack or failing to stop it. Eight others were freed for lack of evidence. A court sentenced four civilians to death in May, including the cleric Mullah Zainul Abideen, who had falsely accused Farkhunda of desecrating the Quran. Eight others had been sentenced to 16-year jail terms. Eleven of the police officers received one-year jail terms while eight others were acquitted. Police were blamed for failing to stop the attack on Farkhunda. Violence against women Anisa Rasooli, a leading lawyer who has been nominated to become Afghanistan's first female Supreme Court judge. Ghani has promised to reform the judicial system. As part of his efforts to promote women's rights and representation in the government, last month he nominated a leading lawyer, Anisa Rasooli, to become Afghanistan's first female Supreme Court judge. The nomination, which requires parliamentary approval, has upset some Islamic clerics in male-dominated, conservative Afghan society. Ghani has also appointed two female governors in Ghor and Daikundi provinces. His cabinet includes four female members. He wants all ministries to start appointing female deputy ministers.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' Report: Plan to Sell Nuclear Materials to IS Thwarted Eastern European gangs have tried to sell radioactive materials to Middle Eastern extremists, including Islamic State, The Associated Press reported Wednesday. Four attempted sales by gangs with suspected Russian connections have been thwarted in the past five years by authorities in the eastern European country of Moldova working with the FBI. AP reports that the last attempt was in February, when a smuggler in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, offered a large cache of deadly cesium and was specifically looking for a buyer from IS. AP reports Grossu was asking for $2.8 million (2.5 million euros) in exchange for the cesium, which is capable of contaminating several city blocks. It took about 20 meetings for the informant to convince Grossu he was IS and make the exchange of cash for the small sample of cesium that landed Grossu in jail. Valentin Grossu is escorted by an armed police officer following his arrest during a cesium smuggling sting operation in Chisinau, Moldova, Feb. 19, 2015. More cases expected AP was given access to Moldovan investigative case files in order to demonstrate how serious the problem of nuclear smuggling is in the impoverished former Soviet bloc country. No one knows how much has filtered into the black market. In this combination of images provided by the Moldova General Police Inspectorate, a sample of uranium-235 is tested for radioactivity in Chisinau, Moldova, June 27, 2011. Malic and the other Moldovan investigators were on a short learning curve, going from near ignorance of nuclear smuggling to closing four cases in five years by penetrating smuggling networks posing as gangsters. The FBI helped by providing high tech gear such as radiation detectors and clothing threaded with recording devices. At times, Malic calmed his nerves with shots of vodka before going undercover. AP reports that a middle man working for the Colonel was recorded arranging the sale of the bomb grade uranium, U-235, and blueprints for a dirty bomb to a man from Sudan. Teodor Chetrus is detained by a police officer in Chisinau, Moldova during a uranium-235 sting operation, June 27, 2011. But Agheenco got away and, police say, may have more nuclear material to sell. AP reports that most of the arrests were made after cash was exchanged for samples. There were strategic reasons for this, but the results were that kingpins got away and those arrested were able to evade long prison sentences and return to nuclear smuggling. And the bulk of the nuclear material being marketed is still out there.',\n",

Two people were arrested and 470 are currently detained by the Home Affairs Ministry in a nearby prison. Most are undocumented foreign nationals. As dawn broke in Johannesburg, hordes of heavily armed South African police and army units arrived to raid the church. The illegal foreign nationals were carted off in armored vans. A bedroom for several people who have sought refuge is seen at the church, Johannesburg, South Africa, May 8, 2015. (Gillian Parker/VOA) Wake up! Wake up! They said everyone must sit down on the ground floor. Police spokesman Lt. Blankets left on makeshift cardboard beds signalled a hasty departure for some 2,000 people staying in the church. Those who escaped the raid later returned to pack their modest belongings into large shopping bags with little clue of where to go. Mambu said that she and her husband had few choices. Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church became a sanctuary for foreign nationals following a wave of xenophobic violence in 2008. Most who stayed here are illegal immigrants from other parts of Africa as well as South Africans with nowhere else to go. Conditions in the church are unsanitary. Bottles filled with urine line the stairwell with empty food packets and burger boxes strewn across the floor. The possessions of the displaced foreigners are put in a bin if they go unclaimed, Johannesburg, South Africa, May 8, 2015. (Gillian Parker/VOA) A surge of xenophobic attacks last month left at least eight people dead and forced thousands of foreigners to desert their homes and businesses. Some might be eligible for asylum, but rights groups say that there is incompetence and corruption in Home Affairs, making it difficult for many migrants to get documents. Those who were staying at the church argue that church members wanted them out at any cost. Bishop Ndumiso Ncombo said this was not the case. Many are likely to be sent back to their countries regardless of what they might face on their return.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' A Russian court for the first time has sentenced an activist to three years in prison under a 2014 law for repeatedly protesting without permission. The sentence was a year longer than what prosecutors were seeking. The law allows Russian authorities to hand down criminal sentences of up to five years in prison after four unsanctioned demonstrations within a six-month period. Dadin was first detained in 2012 for protesting the conviction of anti-government demonstrators. He was detained several times since and placed under house arrest in January after his fourth unsanctioned demonstration since 2014. Denis Krivosheev, deputy director for Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International, told VOA three more people are being investigated under the law. He said they expect another conviction pretty soon. One of the people being investigated is 75-year-old Vladimir Ionov, who was the first to face criminal charges under the 2014 law, but has not yet been sentenced. FILE - A man speaks to police at an unsanctioned protest in Moscow, Russia, Dec. 30, 2014. Broadcaster targeted Rights groups said the raid was an obvious attempt to pressure the station, one of the few remaining broadcasters in Russia willing to give voice to critics of the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin. In 2014, Russian cable providers dropped the channel after pressure from authorities over a poll questioning if surrender to the Nazis would have been better than the human costs of the 1940s siege of Leningrad. Despite its limited reach, unlike state broadcasters, Dozhd refuses to bow to authorities and often interviews opposition politicians and activists. Soviet era comparisons Rights groups say the tightening of restrictions on voices critical of the Kremlin is a pattern reminiscent of Soviet times. Since Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012, amid massive anti-government protests, Russia has enacted tighter controls on freedom of assembly, the press, foreign organizations, and groups that receive foreign funding. Rights groups say many have scaled back operations or closed down because of the label.',\n",

       " {'content': \" Baton Rouge and Ferguson: A Tale of Two Police Shootings The mantra has been heard often since the 2014 shooting of a black man by a white police officer in Ferguson led to weeks of protests and turned the Midwestern town into a symbol of police brutality and fractured race relations. The latest echo came in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where protesters last week and over the weekend took to the streets to decry the July 5 killing of a black man by white police. Ferguson is a tiny suburb of the Midwestern U.S. city of St. Louis; Baton Rouge, the mid-sized capital of the southern state of Louisiana with a population 10 times Ferguson's. But similarities are there, and they're hard to ignore: both are largely African-American towns that have a mostly white police force accused of fatally shooting an innocent black man. Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Washington. FILE - Officers and protesters face off along West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Missouri, Aug. 10, 2015. HRW has been monitoring the situation in Baton Rouge, and had people on the ground in Ferguson two years ago. Not all police shootings fit the pattern, say experts. The July 6 fatal police shooting of Philando Castile, an African-American who was stopped in his car for a broken taillight outside St. Paul, Minnesota, has triggered as much outrage as the shooting in Baton Rouge. However, the incident was not caught on camera, although the aftermath was live-streamed on Facebook. Subsequent protests were relatively smaller, and the police response more measured. Baton Rouge Baton Rouge was thrust into the national spotlight when police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black CD vendor outside a convenience store after receiving a 911 call that a person with a gun was threatening another person. A police search warrant filed Monday claimed that officers had spotted a handgun in Sterling's pocket and they saw him reach for it before shooting him. But the owner of the convenience store, who recorded one of two videos of the shooting, has disputed the police version. The U.S. Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting. By all accounts, the first two days of protests that followed Sterling's shooting were peaceful. But then the protesters, joined by the radical New Black Panther Party and later by the Nation of Islam, upped the ante, assembling outside the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department on Friday and veering onto a highway in what police described as a deliberate attempt to disrupt traffic. To disperse the protesters, police put on a show of force. With a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) emitting an ear-splitting sound from an armored personnel carrier, police in riot gear and gas masks moved to clear the highway, forcibly removing protesters. Some brandished assault rifles. FILE - Police arrest Black Lives Matter leader Deray McKesson during a protest along Airline Highway, a major road that passes in front of the Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters, July 9, 2016. All told, between 150 and 200 protesters were arrested over a three-day period, including Deray McKesson, nationally known leader of the Black Lives Matter movement. McKesson used the Periscope app to livestream the standoff and his own arrest. McKesson said the police tactics were provocative and even violent. To one outside expert, they seemed excessive. In Baton Rouge, opinion remained divided. FILE - A demonstrator is detained by police during protests in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, July 10, 2016. A 2015 study commissioned by the Urban Congress of African American Males in Baton Rouge shows that more than half of black men in Baton Rouge drop out of high school before graduation. Fifty-four percent of black men without high school diplomats are likely to be unemployed, with a 70 percent chance of being incarcerated. Dallas as role model The high rate of fatal police shootings in the U.S. has alarmed public officials in recent years. According to a Washington Post tally, 990 people were killed by police last year, and 515 have been fatally shot so far this year. Black Americans, who represent just 13 percent of the U.S. population, account for nearly one-third of the shootings. The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and other high-profile shootings of black men sparked a national debate about police reform and race relations, leading President Barack Obama to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing in December 2014. The group of police leaders, academics and activists produced a host of recommendations, ranging from adopting community policing to eliminating incentive-based quotas for arrests. But selling the plan to local law enforcement agencies has been an uphill battle. That is because, unlike most countries, the U.S. doesn't have a national police force; policing in the country is carried out by local departments. Of an estimated 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the country, less than 1 percent is said to have embraced the recommendations. Just before the July 7 sniper shooting that killed five of its men, DPD was tweeting clips of a peaceful rally and photos of smiling officers with protesters. FILE - A Dallas Police officer hugs a child who came to pay respects at a makeshift memorial at Dallas Police Headquarters following the multiple police shootings in Dallas, Texas, July 9, 2016. The Dallas Police Department's success was built on trust, he added. Uncertain future The protests in Baton Rouge are likely to continue in one form or another in the days to come, as they did Monday when a small group led by the Nation of Islam gathered outside the convenience store where Sterling was killed last week. Baton Rouge hasn't seen anything like this since 2005, when Hurricane Katrina drove tens of thousands of residents of New Orleans into the city, said The Advocate's Kovacs. Sterling's funeral is scheduled for Friday.\",\n",

All three campaigns are coping with party rules that make the California race a series of local battles. Police and protesters outside the site of the Republican Party California convention. (M. O'Sullivan/VOA) Trump maneuvered past hundreds of protesters to arrive at the California site and walked along a concrete barrier behind the hotel. Undecided (M. O'Sullivan/VOA) Aguila is Mexican American and rejects the criticism that Trump is a racist. Outside the hotel, Mexican American Rosa Penate was one of many who disagreed. She held a sign that accused Trump of racist bigotry. Police officers take a man into custody who was protesting against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outside the Hyatt Regency hotel during the California Republican Party 2016 Convention in Burlingame, Calif., April 29, 2016. Several protesters tried to force their way through the police line to enter the hotel, and they advanced a few meters before police pushed them back. Authorities say at least five were arrested. Inside, the delegates were focused on choices and strategy. Michael Schroeder, co-chairman of the Cruz campaign in California, wrote the rules that govern the Republican nominating process when he was California Republican chairman from 1997-'99. Choosing delegates It makes no difference, said Schroeder, who wins the popular vote in the state. If Trump secures the needed 1,237 delegates from all Republican state primaries and caucuses, he will be the nominee. If not, delegates to the nominating convention will hold second or third votes, when they are free to switch support to a different candidate. That could open the door to a Cruz nomination. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, waves during a rally in Indianapolis, April 27, 2016, when Cruz announced he has tapped Fiorina to serve as his running mate. Schroeder said the Cruz campaign has mobilized 41,000 volunteers in a process that started last June. Political scientist Josh Putnam of the University of Georgia said for Cruz, the strategy is simple. Kasich hopes waning FILE - Republican presidential candidates, from left, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich participate in a Republican presidential debate at the University of Miami, in Coral Gables, Fla., March 10, 2016. However, barring a prolonged fight at the national convention, a Kasich nomination is unlikely. Cruz supporters say their efforts in California could shift the tide. His announced running mate, Californian Carly Fiorina, will address the San Francisco meeting Saturday night.\",\n",

Bertone says the leap from victim to entrepreneur has been made easy for those savvy in the use of their smartphones. . Young people can use text messages and social media to book clients and make transactions, experts explain. Standing on dark street corner wearing a short skirt and stiletto heels is no longer a prerequisite. In some ways, that helps to make child prostitution an invisible crime. Bertone says society needs to address the needs of those children who become involved in prostitution. Bertone encourages authorities to introduce other ways of engaging young girls in more productive ways. A web search found reports going back five years where authorities had arrested or charged teenagers for recruiting other teen girls for prostitution in at least a dozen countries, including the United States and Canada.',\n",

       " {'content': \" Panetta: Killing of Kim Jong Nam Reflects Instability in Pyongyang Kim Jong Nam, 45, died February 13 after allegedly being poisoned by two women at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Malaysian police said Friday that the poison used to kill Kim was the VX nerve agent, which is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, is pictured at the Beijing International Airport, China, February 2007. While the investigation is still underway, police have arrested the women and one North Korean national. They are seeking seven other North Koreans, including one diplomat in the Malaysian capital, for questioning. South Korea believes Kim Jong Un ordered the killing of his half brother. North Korea has denied responsibility, accusing South Korea and Malaysia of plotting to have it blamed for the death. Sign of instability Once deemed the legitimate heir to North Korea's ruling regime, Kim Jong Nam was known to be favored by China. Christine Wormuth, former undersecretary for policy at the U.S. Defense Department, said Kim's death could be seen as a snub to Beijing. FILE - An employee walks between front-end loaders used to move coal imported from North Korea at Dandong port in the Chinese border city of Dandong, Dec. 7, 2010. China's reaction Several days after Kim's assassination, China announced it would suspend imports of North Korean coal for the rest of 2017. The North's coal exports account for about one-third of the country's total export income, generating an estimated $1 billion a year for the regime, according to U.S. officials. In an apparent protest against China's ban, North Korea's state media on Thursday harshly criticized China without mentioning its name. Panetta said he thought Chinese leaders had long been concerned about Kim Jong Un's behavior and that the incident in Malaysia would further isolate his country. The news of the killing came amid heightened tensions over the North's recent missile test, which took place a day before Kim died. Reinstatement of sanctions Some U.S. lawmakers are calling for returning North Korea to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Washington removed Pyongyang from the list in October 2008 as part of a nuclear deal in which the communist state agreed to disable a plutonium plant and allow some inspections. U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, is also calling for the reinstatement of the North to the list. VOA's Cho Eunjung contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" A Second Night of Chicago Protests Over Police Shooting Protesters took to the streets of Chicago for the second straight night Wednesday, one day after the city's police department released video of a black teenager being shot to death by a white officer. The protesters rallied in downtown Chicago, following the release of video that showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in October 2014. Van Dyke was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder. They also showed pictures of black people who had been killed by police in recent years and called on people to prevent similar tragedies from happening again. Two Chicago police officers take a man into custody during a protest march, Wednesday, Nov. 25, 2015, in Chicago, the day after murder charges were brought against police officer Jason Van Dyke in the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Protesters arrested Several people were arrested during the protests. Demonstrators took lights off a Christmas tree in a park, according to U.S. media reports. TV footage showed protesters trying to pull police bicycles away from officers. You know somebody out there always cares about us. It makes no point to shoot somebody that never even tried to hurt a cop. It's senseless. Police and police vehicles patrolled streets in downtown Chicago amid the protests to ensure safety on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday. Demonstrators also took to the streets Wednesday night in New York City, following a recent incident in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in which five people were shot during a protest conducted by the group Black Lives Matter near a police station. The five were part of a crowd protesting the recent fatal police shooting a black man. TV footage showed protesters converging on the Macy's department store in downtown Manhattan. No damage was reported. U.S. media reported that police arrested several people during the New York protests. Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke is seen in an undated picture released by the Cook County state's attorney's office in Chicago. Van Dyke fired In Chicago, Van Dyke turned himself in to authorities Tuesday and has been charged with first degree murder. He also has been fired from the police department. The officer is accused of shooting McDonald 16 times, with many of those shots coming after McDonald was on the ground. In the video, McDonald is running down the center of a street toward several police cars, then apparently walks away from police holding what police say was a knife. No sound is heard before Van Dyke opens fire and continues firing after McDonald falls to the ground. The Chicago Tribune newspaper quotes police as saying McDonald was behaving erratically, had drugs in his system, and refused police commands to drop a knife he was holding. The Chicago shooting is another in a series of highly publicized police shootings and deadly assaults of young black men by officers -- mostly white, some black. Chicago police have said they will not tolerate criminal behavior during the protests. People have a right to protest. People have a right to free speech. A court ordered the city to release the police car camera video of the shooting of Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke. The order came after a journalist filed a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request to make the video public.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Austria's Largest Refugee Camp Readies for Winter Serving 2,600 people in a kitchen intended for no more than half that figure is a challenging task, but staff and management in Traiskirchen are slowly figuring out how to deal with the notoriously overcrowded camp. Patience is key for those waiting in long lines that extend to the courtyard of Austria's biggest reception center for migrants and asylum-seekers. One day, they were rewarded with a generous portion of chicken, rice and a side salad. A tractor is seen transporting supplies through the make-shift reception center for migrants and asylum-seekers in Traiskirchen, Austria. (Photo - VOA video grab) Varied tastes Walter Ruscher, the Interior Ministry's human rights coordinator for Traiskirchen, is aware of the complaints. Satisfying everyone's taste, especially considering the multiple ethnicities in Traiskirchen, is an impossible task. But food has been low on the government's priority list. In July, when an unprecedented number of asylum-seekers reached Austria, about 4,600 people were living inside the reception center in Traiskirchen. There were people sleeping outside in the open. Hundreds of children, women and men slept on the bare ground, unsheltered from heatwaves and rainstorms. Since then, Traiskirchen has been the focus of outrage of local media and concerned citizens who believe that one of the world's wealthiest nations should treat better people in need. Residents of the reception center for migrants and asylum-seekers in Traiskirchen, Austria, are seen lining up for food at the camp's kitchen. (Photo - VOA video grab) Slight improvements Tents have been set up since, and no one is sleeping out in the open anymore, but Traiskirchen is still considered an eyesore. Few news outlets have been granted access, and there's a general sentiment among local media that the government is hiding what's happening inside Traiskirchen. But the Interior Ministry is trying to improve the image of Traiskirchen, and said that any media outlet asking for permission to access the facility would get an appointment for a supervised tour. Each new arrival gets toilet articles, as well as clothing and shoes. Baby carriages are available, young men play on soccer pitches and basketball courts. There's also a beautifully decorated school with drawings of farm animals, and when children don't want to attend the voluntary classes, there's several playgrounds with swings and monkey bars. The tent city with its 15 showers still houses 720 people. The influx of migrants, most of them from the Middle East and Africa, has been overwhelming. Migrants and asylum-seekers are seen walking on the grounds of the make-shift reception center in Traiskirchen, Austria. (Photo - VOA video grab) Asylym-seekers In 2010, a total of 11,000 people sought asylum in Austria. In the first nine months of this year, the government registered 52,000. The Germany, which has a population of about 80 million, has a land mass about four times larger than Austria, which has about 8 million residents. Last year, we'd have 50, or maybe up to 80 applications per day. Recently, the camp distributed electric radiant heaters, as nighttime temperatures have dipped to near freezing. As a cluster of people quickly teemed around workers delivering the heaters inside the tent city, a security staff member assured migrants there would be enough heaters for each tent. The tents are only a stop-gap solution in case all the bunks beds inside are taken, Ruscher said. An employee of ORS, a subsidiary of a Switzerland-based enterprise managing Austria's migrant camps, is seen talking to residents of the reception center in Traiskirchen, Austria. (Photo - VOA video grab) Permanent facilities Over the next few weeks, once distribution to more permanent facilities in each province is better organized, the ministry hopes to be able to move all remaining asylum-seekers at Traiskirchen indoors. But even if conditions have improved, opposition parties such as the Green party criticize the way Traiskirchen and other federal facilities are run. Instead of having asylum-seekers' facilities run by the government or a nonprofit organization, such as Caritas, the largest relief organization in Austria, the task was handed to ORS, a private company. Ruscher, of the Interior Ministry, said NGOs had bid for the contract, but that the cost of running Traiskirchen and similar facilities would have been twice as high. In the taxpayers' interest, the government opted for the cheaper ORS.\",\n",

The legislation, introduced this week by Republican Representatives Ted Poe of Texas and Dana Rohrabacher of California, accuses Pakistan of harboring global terrorist leaders and supporting terror groups. Among those groups is the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated terrorist entity that opposes the Afghanistan government and U.S.-led NATO forces in the country. FILE - Women chant slogans condemning Islamist terrorism during an anti-terror rally in Lahore, Pakistan, Jan. 16, 2015.

Pakistani officials also say thousands of Pakistani lives have been lost in terror attacks. He did not address the issue of terrorist groups targeting neighboring countries from Pakistan. Facing isolation A deadly attack on Indian soldiers in Kashmir this week increased the tension between Pakistan and India to levels not seen since the terror attack on Mumbai in 2008. India blames Pakistan for allowing the attack. The Pakistan government has rejected the allegations and accuses India of oppressing Kashmiris and violating their human rights. U.S., Afghan opposition Islamabad is also at odds with Washington and Kabul over Pakistan's support of Afghan militant groups. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked Sharif, during a meeting this week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, to prevent Pakistan from being used as a harbor for terrorists.

       " {'content': \" Drowned Syrian Boys' Aunt Fights to Bring Family to Canada The aunt of a drowned Syrian boy whose death has sparked global outrage about the plight of refugees in Europe says she still hopes to bring the rest of her family to Canada. Tima Kurdi said through tears outside her home in Coquitlam, British Columbia, that she plans to help her brother, Abdullah, and her other siblings immigrate to the country she made home more than two decades ago. Abdullah isn't ready to leave his Syrian hometown of Kobani, where his sons, 3-year-old Alan and 5-year-old Ghalib, and wife Rehanna were buried on Friday, she said. They drowned earlier this week after piling into an overloaded boat in Bodrum, Turkey, headed for the Greek island of Kos. Her brother was among the few survivors. A paramilitary police officer carries the lifeless body of a migrant child after a number of migrants died and a smaller number were reported missing after boats carrying them to the Greek island of Kos capsized, near Bodrum, Sept. 2, 2015. He cannot be by himself there.'' Kurdi has previously said she wanted to bring both her brothers to Canada, but she applied first for her eldest sibling Mohammed, whose application was rejected because it was incomplete. She said that Mohammed's failed application prompted Abdullah to embark on the risky journey with his family. She said she sent him $5,000 to pay smugglers to take them in a boat. Asked whether her brother blames himself, Kurdi said no. I sent him the money to pay the smuggler. They were fleeing horrors in Syria, where militants from the Islamic State group had beheaded one of her sister-in-law's relatives. Kurdi said her brother had emailed her a photo of the killing but she deleted it because it was too horrific. Abdullah Kurdi, father of three-year old Alan Kurdi, cries as he leaves a morgue in Mugla, Turkey, Sept. 3, 2015. Abdullah knew of the dangers, including the risk of smugglers using fake life-jackets, she said, adding he had planned to pay 2,000 euros ($2,230) each for him and his wife to board a safer jet boat, compared to 1,200 euros ($1,338) for a rubber boat. There was no fee for the two boys. Photos of Alan's lifeless body on a beach in Turkey have put Canada's refugee policy in the spotlight, though Kurdi said she doesn't blame the Canadian government. She said she hopes Citizenship and Immigration Canada stops requiring a document missing from Mohammed's application because it's impossible for people to secure the necessary paperwork amid a crisis in Syria. Kurdi spoke to both her brothers by phone on Friday and watched emotional video on CNN of her two young nephews being buried in Kobani. In this image made from video, mourners carry a coffin during the burial of Rehan Kurdi and her sons Alan, 3, and Galip, 5, after they drowned during a desperate voyage from Turkey to Greece, in their hometown of Kobani, the Syrian Kurdish region they fl She said she desperately wished she could be there with her brother to say goodbye. It's dangerous,''' she said, weeping. Her grieving brother is proud of his kids for becoming a symbol of the dire situation facing Syrian refugees, and hopes to see leaders step in to end human smuggling, Kurdi said. What I have is gone.' But my kids, and my wife, it's a wake-up call for the world. And hopefully they step in and help others.''\",\n",

       " {'content': ' Flow of Foreign Fighters to Iraq, Syria Unrelenting New figures on the flow of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq show the scope of the problem is much bigger than first thought, with would-be militants still finding their way to the battlefront. For the second time this week, intelligence officials have released updated estimates on the number of foreign fighters, now saying more than 36,500 from at least 120 countries have gone to take part in the fight since the start of the conflict. That figure includes at least 6,600 Westerners. The earlier estimates had put the total number of foreign fighters at more than 34,000 from 120 countries, including at least 6,000 Westerners. Back in October, intelligence officials had estimated there were more than 30,000 foreign fighters from at least 115 countries, including more than 4,500 from the West. FILE - Two men accused of fighting with the co-called Islamic State militant group hide their faces before their trial in Germany November 30, 2015. Number of US recruits unchanged Despite the increase in the total, the number of American fighters has remained unchanged since the October estimates, intelligence officials told VOA on condition of anonymity. Of those, about 24 have been killed in Iraq or Syria. Officials familiar with the estimates caution that the increase does not indicate a current surge in foreign fighters, but is likely due to improved reporting as well as ongoing intelligence efforts to identify individuals. Skinner said a majority of foreign fighters likely traveled to the battlefront following the fall of Mosul to Islamic State militants in June 2014; but, he also warned it has proven difficult to shut down the flow. The foreign fighter issue has alarmed some U.S. lawmakers. Through the end of 2015, slightly more than 1,000 foreign fighters a month were joining the Islamic State, a U.S. official familiar with the data told VOA. The official also said the most popular route continued to be crossing into Syria from Turkey, despite Turkish efforts to crack down along the border. Spanish police arrest a man, left, accused of collaborating with the Islamic State, after searching a cybercafe in Mataro near to Barcelona, Dec. 8, 2015. Young people, women drawn to jihad There is also evidence that the jihadist-foreign fighter message continues to resonate with European youth and with women despite counter-messaging efforts.',\n",

Bodies of people killed during a rally are seen at the capital's main mosque in Conakry, Guinea Okey Onyejekwe warns that the entire West African region will be destabilized if Guinea becomes a failed state. The talks were intended to reduce escalating tensions following a failed assassination attempt last week on the junta leader. Guinea's military junta Onyejekwe said there are signs of disagreement within the ranks of the junta. Dadis Camara himself is a captain, but the issue here to me is a lot lager than that. Some political analysts believe suspension of the crisis talks undermines efforts by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve the political crisis. But Onyejekwe says there has been resistance over the choice of Burkina Faso President Blaise Campoare as mediator of the crisis. He also expressed the hope that both the African Union and ECOWAS will intensify efforts to organize elections to ensure a return to constitutional rule.\",\n",

Here in the Old City, security was tight as pilgrims from around the world marched in the traditional Good Friday procession, many of them carrying big wooden crosses. They made their way through the narrow cobblestone streets of the Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, singing hymns and reading scripture as they visited the 14 Stations of the Cross. Jacob Adeyemi, who came from Nigeria, said Jerusalem on Good Friday brings the Bible to life. Turnout was sparse this year in the wake of six months of violence. Jerusalem has been the focal point of a wave of Palestinian stabbing attacks on Israelis, and Israeli police and soldiers were out in force. Policing the procession Italian pilgrim Emilio Carmone said Jerusalem looks like an armed camp. The procession wound up at the ancient Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion. There, on Easter Sunday, Christians will celebrate the resurrection.\",\n",

After Woodhull, there were a few more attempts, but it wasn't until 1964, Freeman argues, that a breakout female candidate shook up American presidential politics. Sen.

       " {'content': \" Little Progress Made in Efforts to Dismantle Human Smuggling Rings On October 3, 2013, hundreds of African migrants desperate to reach Europe died less than 400 meters from reaching their goal. They set a blanket on fire to signal for help, but flames engulfed the ship. The passengers crowded to one side, and the vessel capsized. The official death toll was 368, according to the International Organization for Migration. Others remain missing and most likely drowned. Those rescued live with emotional and physical scars, not only from the sinking but also from the trip itself, because many were raped or tortured by traffickers. In the wake of the Lampedusa tragedy, European authorities set out to crack down on the smugglers and traffickers who sent the migrants to their deaths. They determined that a vast, organized and well-funded network fuels much of the migration out of Africa and the Middle East. For three years, officials from Italy, Britain and other countries have investigated the network behind the Mediterranean migration crisis. Despite a coordinated international approach, millions of dollars spent and untold man hours, the impact of efforts to thwart the smuggling rings remains unclear. Dozens have been arrested and face prosecution. Officials have wiretapped hundreds of calls and mapped the scope of the trafficking networks across continents. But the death toll in the Mediterranean is on track to rise for the third straight year, with at least 10,000 additional migrant deaths recorded in the Mediterranean Sea since Lampedusa. Three wrecks in June 2016 alone may have led to 700 deaths, according to the U.N. refugee agency and IOM. FILE - In this photo released by the Italian Navy Wednesday, April 9, 2014, Italian Navy's dingies approach a boat carrying migrants along the Mediterranean sea, off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa Tens of thousands of refugees arrive on European shores each month. And at least one high-profile case has raised questions about the methods investigators use to find their targets. Initial successes One breakthrough came in 2014 when Nuredin Wehabrebi Atta, an Eritrean smuggler, was arrested and agreed to assist authorities as a whistle-blower in exchange for protection. Atta painted a gruesome picture of the system, saying traffickers often held would-be migrants hostage and extorted their families for money under threat of death to their loved ones. He outlined a wide-reaching network that included arms and drug smugglers. More arrests followed. On July 4, 2016, Italian authorities arrested 25 Eritreans, 12 Ethiopians and an Italian thought to be involved in smuggling after a raid on a perfume shop in Italy. Over 526,000 euros (about $578,000) and $25,000 in cash were discovered in the raid. Authorities also found an address book that contained names of smugglers, according to Reuters. However, Ferrara said the investigation, code-named Glauco, was fraught with challenges from the beginning. Trafficking networks are vast and difficult to infiltrate. Smugglers go to great lengths to conceal money transfers. Investigators often must work from a distance, retracing routes from clues that migrants bring when they land in Europe. Medhane Tesfamariam Berhe is pictured with Italian policemen as they land at Palermo airport, Italy, following his arrest in Khartoum, Sudan, on May 24, in this file photo released June 8, 2016 by Italian police. Image pixelated at source. Big break or mistaken identity? El Diem is a popular spot for migrants to play pool and drink tea and coffee. At a small coffeehouse called Diem, Sudanese authorities apprehended Medhane Tesfamariam Berhe of Eritrea and extradited him to Italy. Italian and British authorities hailed it as the big break they had spent over a year looking for, but it may be a case of mistaken identity that demonstrates the difficulty of dismantling trafficking networks. Following the arrest, family members and journalists questioned whether authorities had the right person. Victims of the actual trafficker testified in court that authorities had arrested the wrong man. Friends in Sudan who knew Berhe insisted that authorities had the wrong person. In this picture taken June 9, 2106, Hiweet Berhe Tesfamarian Kidane holds photocopies of documents she told the Associated Press belong to her brother, Medhane Tesfamariam Berhe, during an interview in Oslo. The confusion began with the name. Eritrean names follow a paternal line, and the suspect extradited to Europe shares only the first, or given, name with the wanted criminal, whom authorities initially identified as Medhane Yehdego Mered. This kingpin is suspected of killing and torturing many migrants. By one account, he controlled 4 percent of the human trafficking into Italy. A photo used by prosecutors and circulated around the world via social media did not match the man who was extradited, he said. Medhane Tesfamariam Berhe is the name of the ringleader, not Medhane Yehdego Mered, they say. Ferrara, however, maintains they have the right person. At a recent closed hearing, authorities presented additional physical evidence. The phone in possession of the individual they apprehended in Khartoum had been used to log in to the same Facebook account and call the same numbers as the person they had been investigating since 2014, prosecutors asserted. Journey's cost Human trafficking and smuggling is a lucrative business. Migrants and refugees spend over $1.1 billion a year, according to The Migrants' Files, a consortium of journalists from 10 European countries. Beyond risking inhumane treatment and jeopardizing their lives, migrants pay smugglers and traffickers large sums of money, often at multiple points in their journeys. But the NCA said that there are also times when smugglers lower prices to entice migrants to board ships in bad weather. Whether or not migrants can make good on their payments, smugglers and traffickers find ways to profit. Amanuel Zaid, an Eritrean living in Virginia, knew the extradited Medhane in Sudan and made observations on smuggling networks during his time in Khartoum. Smugglers based in the Sudanese capital have their own employees across countries in the region, he said. When migrants enter Sudan from places like Ethiopia and Eritrea, smugglers take them to a checkpoint called Hajer to determine who has paid the full amount before letting them pass. Those who have not paid are handed off to be sold as commodities. From Eritrea to Sudan, for example, safe passage could cost between $6,000 and $7,500, Zaid said, but there are additional costs to continue on from Sudan to Libya that could total about $1,600. Children watch as women queue to receive free clothes at a makeshift camp for refugees and migrants at the Greek-Macedonian border near the village of Idomeni, Greece, May 12, 2016. Countries cooperate The NCA collaborates with regional governments such as Greece to stop smugglers through its Invigor operation. It has contributed to the interception of boats en route to Libya with weapons, ammunition and smuggled cigarettes, according to a statement from the spokesperson. Some of these boats are used to transport migrants when returning back, the statement said. Sudanese authorities also say they are eager to help dismantle trafficking networks. Mekki Elmograbi, the media representative of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, says that his government is working with the European Union to bridge gaps and improve the international prosecution system. Elmograbi said there are more than 15 smuggling gangs operating in the region. Ringleaders at large Medhane Tesfamariam Berhe, meanwhile, remains in prison in Italy. To fill biographical details, Calantropo collected documentation from his family. He attended Isak Teweldemedhin Secondary School and underwent military training in Sawa. During his first hearing on July 4, victims tortured by the criminal who shares his name explained their encounters and confirmed to authorities that they had the wrong person. At another hearing this month, it was ruled that he should remain behind bars until his next court date on September 20. All the while, Calantropo said, the real criminal remains at large in Libya, where he has been since 2015.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Egyptian Reporter Aids in Police Crackdown on Gays For a while after the Arab Spring, it looked like gay Egyptians were finally feeling safe enough to step out of the closet. Cairo police stormed a bath house this week after receiving a tip from an investigative journalist. She also posted photographs of the men being loaded into police vans, wearing only bath towels and handcuffs. She later removed the photographs, but not before they managed to circulate across social media. That post has also been removed. It didn't take long for the news of the police operation to get out. These were just the latest arrests in what activists say is a heightening crackdown on lesbian, gay and transgender people that began a year ago. In September, police arrested eight men who had appeared in a gay wedding video posted on YouTube (below). They were sentenced to three years in prison each. In recent years, activists say, social and religious stigma against homosexuality appeared to be lifting, and this encouraged then-20-year-old Ramy Youseff to come out of the closet on Twitter. But, things began turning backward after the army led by general Abdel Fattah el-Sissi ousted Egypt's first freely elected civilian president Mohamed Morsi of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood last year. Since Sissi came to power, activists say as many as 148 homosexuals have been arrested. Egyptian security flank 52 men accused of sexual immorality as they arrive at a Cairo court November 14, 2001. All this means that the final prison sentence could really add up. Boost to police image Targeting the gay community is an easy way for the government to do so, he said. He also blames media for feeding anti-gay hysteria. In addition, says Abbas, stories like these help the Sissi government divert attention from the economic challenges facing Egypt's citizens. But critics say in the case of the bath house raid, it was the show host who alerted police. In her own defense Screenshot from Mona Iraq's FB page taken by Scott Long, Dec. 7, 2014.

       " {'content': \" Speculation Grows That Peace Process With Kurds Could Resume Speculation is growing that the stalled peace process between the Turkish government and the Kurdish rebels could resume after its breakdown last year. Two main factors fuel that belief. For one, nearly half of Turkey's top generals have been removed from office in connection with the failed coup attempt earlier this month, yet despite the Turkish military's disarray, the PKK Kurdish rebel group has not launched any major attacks. In addition, Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party joined other opposition parties in opposing the putsch. General Adem Huduti, the commander of Turkey's Second Army, is the most senior among the military officers detained in the ongoing crackdown on coup plotters. Huduti has led counter-insurgency operations against the PKK since fighting resumed following last year's collapse of the government-backed peace process with the rebels. Many of Turkey's elite special forces and commandos who have been at the forefront of the fight against the PKK have also been detained. Yet the rebels have not moved to take advantage of the chaos within the Turkish military. FILE - Turkish soldiers detain Staff Sergeant Erkan Cikat, suspected of being involved in the recent coup attempt, in Marmaris, Turkey, July 25, 2016. Possibility of peace Turkey's air force, which regularly bombs the PKK, has only launched one strike against rebel bases in neighboring northern Iraq since the failed coup. While PKK skirmishes are still continuing five police officers and soldiers were killed in separate attacks Thursday in the predominantly Kurdish southeast. Ayse Sozen Usluer, the Turkish president's international relations chief, insists there has been no change in policy toward the PKK, but does not rule out that the conflict can be resolved politically. The peace process with the PKK collapsed in July amid mutual recriminations. Its failure led to a resumption of fighting that caused massive destruction in towns and cities across Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast, along with claims by human rights groups of widespread abuses. But Selahattin Demirtas, co-leader of the HDP, Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party, was quick to condemn the coup attempt, and many Kurds heeded Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to go to the streets to oppose it. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, greets Devlet Bahceli before a meeting in Ankara, Turkey, July 25, 2016. Erdogan met Monday with leaders of the main opposition parties, Republican People's Party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, National Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Wait-and-see approach Semih Idiz, a political columnist with Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper, says the PKK is taking a wait-and-see approach. But I think there is a possibility that the government under these conditions will try and go back to some kind of negotiation process with the Kurds or PKK. HDP co-leader Demirtas strongly condemned his exclusion from Erdogan's meeting Monday with parliamentary opposition leaders. However, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim suggested the HDP could be brought into what the government calls a consensus-building process. In what analysts say is an important gesture to the Kurdish minority, the government says it is considering reopening an investigation into the deaths of 34 young Kurdish smugglers four years ago in a Turkish airstrike near Uludere, on Turkey's border with Iraq.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Analysts: Anti-IS Coalition Strikes in Syria Yielding Results An Islamic State judge is among the latest top jihadists to be killed in targeted coalition airstrikes that are seen as beginning to take a toll on the leadership ranks of the terrorist army. U.S. officials vow 2016 will see many more strikes aimed at degrading the militant group's command and control structure and especially of its mid-level battlefield leadership. This undated image, taken from video posted online Jan. 3, 2016, by the communications arm of the Islamic State group, purports to show IS militants executing five men who they accuse of having spied for Britain in Syria. That allegation is dismissed by British authorities. And media activists with Raqqa is being slaughtered silently say the men were linked with their anti-IS network, which documents IS atrocities in the Syrian province. Frequent airstrikes Whatever the truth about the murdered men, coalition airstrikes targeting IS leaders and battlefield commanders and modeled have become more frequent in recent weeks. Last week, a Pentagon spokesman said 10 Islamic State leaders had been killed since early December, including individuals linked to the planning of the November terror attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. Colonel Steve Warren, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military campaign against Islamic State, told reporters that the leadership deaths were affecting IS on the battlefield. Other top figures from the group killed recently include Abdul Qader Hakim, who was slain in the Iraqi city of Mosul on December 24 and, in Syria on the same day, Charaffe al Mouadan. U.S. and European officials say both men were linked to the Paris attacks and were helping to plan other terrorist assaults in Europe. Western governments appear keen to strike back quickly at IS planners responsible for the killing of their citizens, if for no other reason than to reassure their own publics. In August a British drone strike killed Reyaad Khan, a 21-year-old from Cardiff in Wales. In the same month, Junaid Hussain, a 21-year-old hacker-turned-jihadist from Birmingham in Britain, who ran an IS information and recruitment arm from Syria, was killed in a U.S. drone strike near Raqqa. FILE - A masked, black-clad militant, who has been identified by the Washington Post newspaper as a Briton named Mohammed Emwazi, brandishes a knife in this still image from a 2014 video obtained from SITE Intel Group. Granular intelligence Targeted airstrikes require so-called granular intelligence, collected from phone-call intercepts and the monitoring of emails and text messages, information supplied from the ground either from drone and satellite surveillance, and human intelligence offered by spotters and spies. With targeted strikes mounting, IS appears ever more concerned about spies helping to direct the bombing runs or spotting possible jihadists to strike. In the IS propaganda video released Sunday, one of the detained men, Obay Mohammed Abdul Ghani, a 26-year-old, claimed under duress that he was asked to film the tags of a specific car to pinpoint its location so it could be bombed. This image made from gun-camera video taken on July 4, 2015 and released by United States Central Command shows an airstrike on a bridge near Islamic State group-held Raqqa, Syria, that was a key transit route for the militants. In his forced confession, he said he was asked also for a map of the Islamic court building in Raqqa so that it could be bombed - and told to secure the computer IP address for an Australian member of IS so his location could be pinpointed. In another forced confession a detainee says he was sent photographs of British IS fighters and asked to pinpoint their locations so they could be attacked. IS appears to have become increasingly concerned about its vulnerability to airstrikes in Syria. In Raqqa the group has evacuated landmark buildings or thinned out the number of fighters occupying them,and more IS members are showing signs of being security conscious by wearing ski masks. Also, more fighters are being housed among the civilian population, according to anti-IS activists.\",\n",

Police in Dallas say gunman Micah Xavier Johnson had plans to deliver more destruction in Dallas. Dallas police were able to cut short Johnson's plans when the department used a robot to deliver a bomb into the garage where Johnson was holed up. Bomb-making materials and a rambling journal were found at Johnson's home during a search. No criminal record U.S. law enforcement officials said Johnson did not have a criminal record. In an emailed statement, the U.S. Army said Johnson was a carpentry and masonry specialist during his time in the service from March 2009 to April 2015. He was deployed to Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014. Johnson left Afghanistan when a fellow soldier brought sexual harassment charges against him, saying he needed mental health counseling.

Johnson's shoot-out Thursday night with the police in Dallas was triggered, many believe, by police shootings earlier in the week that ended with the deaths of two black men. Johnson was also black. Baton Rouge, Minnesota incidents Tuesday in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, cell phone footage showed police shooting 37-year-old Alton Sterling at point-blank range as he was being held down by two police officers.

A woman protesting the shooting death of Alton Sterling is detained by law enforcement near the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, July 9, 2016. Wednesday evening in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, the fiancée of Philando Castile managed to livestream on her private Facebook account just seconds after a police officer shot Castile several times after pulling them over for a broken tail light. Diamond Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter were in the car when the officer opened fire. Reynolds, who was driving the car, said the officer had been informed Castile had a permit to carry a gun and was reaching for identification when the officer fired several shots from just outside the passenger side window.

       " {'content': \" MSF Says Thousands Flee into Bush in South Sudan State Eight days after a cessation of hostilities agreement was signed for South Sudan, unrest in southern Unity state has forced thousands to flee into the bush, international medical aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Friday. Among those who fled were some 240 South Sudanese MSF staff members, who took some of the most severely ill patients at Leer Hospital with them, the aid group said in a statement. Patients who were able to flee on their own also left the hospital, which was completely empty on Friday, MSF said. MSF said it was extremely worried for the safety and well-being of its staff members and patients. The only way to provide medical care was to take patients out of the hospital and to flee with the population into the bush. Doctors Without Borders on new displacements in South Sudan Since the current crisis began in December, more 860,000 people in South Sudan have been forced to flee their homes, according to a report released Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). An estimated 740,000 people are displaced inside South Sudan, with the largest increase in the past week in Unity state, in particular in oil-producing Leer and Koch counties, OCHA said. Another 123,400 people have fled to neighboring countries. MSF said that more than 10,000 people who had been displaced by fighting in the Unity state capital, Bentiu, and fled to Leer have been displaced a second time by the recent fighting. Prior to the outbreak of fighting on Dec. 15, that number was one million, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, Toby Lanzer, said in a tweet. The number of civilians with acute & emergency food needs in #SouthSudan has risen from 1 million before 15 December to well over 3 million. The warring sides in South Sudan signed two agreements in Addis Ababa last week -- one to cease fighting and the other on the status of 11 political figures who were detained when the unrest erupted in mid-December. Seven of the 11 political detainees have been conditionally released to the custody of the Kenyan government, but South Sudan has said it has evidence to charge the remaining four with treason. Women carry the body of a civilian killed in the center of Malakal, Upper Nile State in South Sudan, Jan. 21, 2014. Although the cessation of hostilities agreement called for fighting to stop within 24 hours of the pact's signing, there have been reports of clashes around South Sudan, particularly in Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile states, which have seen some of the heaviest fighting of the six-week conflict. MSF repeated calls made in the cessation of hostilities agreement for parties to the South Sudan conflict to allow aid organizations access to affected communities, and allow patients to receive medical treatment irrespective of their origin or ethnicity. Empty tins litter the ground at the looted compound of an aid agency in Malakal, South Sudan.

       " {'content': \" Analysis: Afghan Talks Reflect Russian Moves to Expand Global Influence With the Trump administration still stitching together its foreign policy, priorities and staff, Russia seems intent on expanding its once-shrunken sphere of influence by exploiting gaps in America's overseas presence. It's been a globe-spanning effort, with Russian leader Vladimir Putin using muscle in places like Ukraine and Syria and offering sweeteners to potential allies that he hopes will pay off later. The focus is on countries that have shaky ties with Washington, are strategically located or have abundant natural resources. A key issue is how Putin's relationship with new President Donald Trump will pan out. Can two cocky personalities truly be allies against common foes like Islamic State, which could usher in a new era of cooperation? Are the distrust and animosity that festered during the Cold War too much to overcome? And will there be long-term fallout over Russia's efforts to bolster Trump's election campaign? FILE - President Donald Trump speaks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Jan. 28, 2017, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington. Russia's influence, which rivaled that of the United States during the Cold War, faded dramatically after the fall of communism and the breakup of the vast Soviet Union. But under Putin, it has sought to re-establish itself in an effort that has stretched from the North Sea to Antarctica. In its latest initiative, Russia seeks to transform itself from an erstwhile warmonger in Afghanistan, during its failed decade-long invasion, into a peacemaker. On Wednesday, Moscow hosted a second-round of peace talks on the resource-rich country. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India and China were invited. The United States was conspicuously left out, despite its ongoing military intervention to repel Islamic terrorists and put Afghanistan solidly on the road to stability. Common enemies Afghanistan watchers in the region say Moscow wants to play a more active role closer to home after its actions in Syria. FILE - Boxes of ammunition are seen inside a Russian aircraft at the International Kabul Airport, Afghanistan, Feb. 24, 2016. Afghan officials took delivery of 10,000 automatic rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition as a gift from Russia. The United States, China and Russia have interests in Afghanistan, some of which might pit them against one another. But Yousafzai said fighting against Islamic State could potentially be a common cause. Controversial friends However, Russia has forged ties with Afghanistan's rebel Taliban movement, seeing them as an ally against Islamic State, and that has put it at odds with Washington. Moscow claims it's just trying to foster peace; the U.S. says Russia's aid is helping the Taliban to wage its war against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. Russia's intervention in Afghanistan may be driven in large part by its desire to stop the spread of Islamist extremism through the Muslim Central Asian states and the flow of narcotics from poppy-producing Afghanistan, said Sami Yousafzai, an Afghan correspondent who has been reporting for several international media organizations. But the landlocked country also is strategically located, which was a major factor in Russia's 1979 invasion. Cozying up to Moscow might not yield the Taliban the benefits of international legitimacy or consideration as a political force within Afghanistan because Russia does not have a very influential global role and has angered many Sunni-Muslim states in the Middle East with its support for Shi'ite Iran, said Sami Yousafzai, who is not related to Rahimullah Yousafzai. FILE - An Afghan policeman walks past a bloodstained wall after Taliban fighters stormed a government compound in Kandahar province, July 9, 2014. Broad interests The interest in Afghanistan only scratches the surface of Moscow's interest and mirrors China's aggressive efforts to build up its presence in the South China Sea. Some see the possibility of limited cooperation between Moscow and Beijing to counterbalance U.S. influence. Both have been taking advantage of a relatively hands-off approach to foreign policy in some areas under former President Barack Obama. Russia has been accused of political meddling across the Balkans, reportedly countering U.S. interests to the point of disruption. Moscow donated weapons and other military hardware a year ago to the Pacific nation of Fiji, which has been developing new allies after being isolated by sanctions for its military coup in 2006. Russia also has been cultivating a relationship with Libya, which could lead to cooperation with Washington or could develop into a point of conflict. And Moscow has been bolstering its presence as far away as Antarctica, which is believed to have vast stores of natural resources, while pursuing interests in the Arctic as the melting icecap provides access to previously blocked areas.

Besigye, runner-up in the February 18 presidential election to longtime incumbent Yoweri Museveni, was arrested Wednesday in Kampala after eluding the round-the-clock blockade and surveillance of his home on the city's outskirts. He was then flown to Moroto town in the northeastern subregion of Karamoja. Museveni, whom the country's Electoral Commission declared the winner in the February election, was sworn in for a fifth presidential term Thursday. He has been in office since 1986. However, on Wednesday, a video purportedly showing Besigye being sworn in as the new president of Uganda was placed on YouTube and being shared on Facebook and other social media platforms.

Kanyeihamba said Ugandan authorities singled Besigye out from that purported Twitter picture and charged him with treason. Kanyeihamba said the government and the police need to explain the case.

       " {'content': \" Tight Clinton-Trump Race Roiled by New Email Probe Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump remain locked in a tight contest for the U.S. presidency, nine days ahead of the November 8 election, with the campaign roiled by the new investigation into her emails while she served as secretary of state. One tracking poll of voter sentiment, by The Washington Post and ABC News, showed Clinton clinging to a narrow edge over Trump by a single percentage point, 46 to 45 percent. The two news outlets said the poll of likely voters covered part of the time after FBI Director James Comey announced that investigators are taking a new look at her use of a private email server while she was the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. Impact on November 8 vote The Post-ABC survey said that more than six in 10 voters said the new investigation would make no difference in their vote on November 8, but of those who said it would matter, more than 3 in 10 said it would make them less likely to vote for her, and only 2 percent that it would influence them to vote for her. New polling by a raft of news organizations and universities in the coming days could give a better idea whether the FBI investigation will matter in how people vote. Clinton, who has often said her use of the private email server was a mistake, has demanded that Comey spell out details of what is in the emails that were found on the computer of one of her key aides, Huma Abedin, shared with her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Hillary Clinton speaks with senior aide Huma Abedin (L) aboard her campaign plane at an airport in White Plains, New York, Oct. 28, 2016. The FBI found the potentially incriminating emails on a computer Abedin shared with her estranged husband. she asked cheering supporters. Boon for Trump Most polls, many of them conducted before the Comey announcement, show Clinton ahead by about four or five percentage points across the country, with often narrower edges in key election states. The state-by-state outcomes will determine the winner in the country's Electoral College, not the national popular vote. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, Oct. 30, 2016. New emails from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state have given Trump's campaign an unexpected boost. Trump started his Sunday campaigning with a stop at a nondenominational church in Las Vegas, Nevada, a closely contested western state, where he swayed and clapped to the music. He planned a later rally in the city and then stops in two other nearby states, Colorado and New Mexico.

Korea Jams GPS, Blocks VOA, Twitter, Facebook, Other Media North Korea has begun jamming GPS signals in South Korea, affecting some communications and navigation systems, and it also said Friday it is blocking a number of popular websites. Many computer networks and software programs rely on signals sent from the worldwide network of global-positioning satellites. North Korea has been sending signals from ground-based transmitters on frequencies overlapping those used by GPS satellites, so the jamming did not cause any significant, widespread effect. However, GPS problems were reported by more than 50 airliners flying over the Korean Peninsula, and they evidently affected hundreds of South Korean fishing boats, some of which returned to port as a result. Authorities in Seoul said the jamming did not hamper ongoing U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises, which have been repeatedly denounced by the communist North. Separately, North Korea announced officially Friday that it is blocking web pages from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, the Voice of America and a number of South Korean media sites. Very few North Koreans have Internet access, but foreign residents and visitors previously have been able to access web pages with almost no overt restrictions. More than 2 million North Koreans now are estimated to use mobile phones, but with few exceptions access to the Internet is limited to officials, technicians or others who have special permission to use it, usually under close supervision. The restrictions will make it more difficult for visitors or foreign residents to post real-time information about the reclusive country to the outside world. It did not say what the punishment would be. FILE - In this Friday March 16, 2012 file photo, North Korean woman uses a mobile phone on a sidewalk in Pyongyang, North Korea.

FILE - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un salutes as he arrives to inspect a military drill at an unknown location, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, March 25, 2016. The North Korean economy has improved under Kim Jong Un in part because of the economic reforms he implemented that allow farmers to sell a portion of the crops they produce, and provides some industries more incentives and control to manage their production and workforce. But North Korean mineral exports, most of which are banned under the new sanctions, and the export of North Korean labor has also helped improve overall economic conditions, even if the vast majority of earnings have gone to ruling elites and the military. North Korea has requested nearly half a million tons of food aid from other countries. But only 17,600 tons had been donated by early February. There is some concern that giving more food aid to North Korea would undermine the sanctions by allowing the leadership to direct more funding to develop nuclear weapons. But there is also concern that the vast majority of North Koreans already living in poverty conditions will suffer the most from these tough new international restrictions. Youmi Kim in Seoul contributed to this report. Some information for this report was provided by AP.\",\n",

Some, like a projection of tanks on the facade of the U.S. White House, are not so subtle. State-sponsored? Allegations of Russian government-sponsored hacking have become a major issue in the U.S. presidential election campaign, with American officials accusing Moscow of trying meddle in the vote. SET refuses to say if their activities are state-sponsored. But there is no doubt that supporters of President Vladimir Putin are behind them. A mannequin soldier holding a rifle overlooks the office. (VOA video screengrab) Similar operations all over Russia We got these trolls and also we got the new level, much more sophisticated level, of hacking attacks.

A poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and genetic links in the colors of the Russian and Ukrainian flags is seen at the office of pro-Kremlin youth group SET (Network). (VOA video screengrab) Also in early October, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of e-mails from a private e-mail account belonging to John Podesta, campaign manager for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. His Google e-mail account was apparently hacked earlier this year after he clicked on a phishing link. Continued denials The Kremlin denies any link to trolls or to the recent hacking attacks against political and election organizations in the United States and has condemned U.S. threats to retaliate. Cybersecurity experts say attribution of malware, software designed to disrupt or damage, is a challenge. But while the choice of target can indicate motive, it is not the only indication of a state actor. Hillary Clinton as target The initial goal of the hacking of the U.S. Democratic Party apparently was to leak compromising material on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Unlike her opponent, Republican candidate Donald Trump, she is seen as someone who would continue a tough policy against Russia, says Soldatov. An activist is seen talking on her phone at the office of pro-Kremlin youth group SET (Network). To her left is a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin. (VOA video screengrab) Lozhkin, a former federal cybercrime investigator, says the number of state-sponsored hacking attacks is doubling each year as technology shifts state efforts from people-to-people to malware-against-malware. Little effect on US election Despite the high-profile attacks on U.S. political groups, cybersecurity experts say there is little effect on the presidential election. Nonetheless, Soldatov says, at some level, the Kremlin is still winning. Meaning that the Americans were ready to talk only about computers and cables and the Russians wanted to talk about content. And it now seems after the annexation of Crimea, after trolls, after RT (Russian government-funded news network) and all this propaganda, everybody including Americans accepted the Russian terminology.',\n",

       " {'content': \" Top Mexican Official Said to Tip Drug Cartel About US Probe In a major embarrassment for Mexican law enforcement, U.S. prosecutors said in documents made public Wednesday that the commander of a Mexican police intelligence-sharing unit was passing information on a DEA investigation to the Beltran Leyva drug cartel in exchange for millions of dollars. Ivan Reyes Arzate was named in a U.S. district court indictment, just hours after Mexico's federal police revealed an unnamed agent had been charged with obstructing an investigation. What Mexican police commissioner Manelich Castilla did not reveal was that Ivan Reyes Arzate, the officer charged, was the commander of a federal police sensitive investigative unit. The special units, known as SIUs, were formed starting in the 1990s precisely to create more secure groups that the U.S. could feel more comfortable sharing intelligence with. Castilla said Reyes Arzate had been fired in November. According to the U.S. indictment, Reyes Arzate was caught on a wiretap in September telling a drug trafficker to get rid of his communications equipment because he was under investigation and his phones were being tapped. FILE - Mexican federal police officers are seen standing guard during a raid. He even sent the trafficker a surveillance photo that the Mexican unit had taken of him. The U.S. indictment unsealed Wednesday in Chicago says Reyes Arzate was the top commander of an SIU unit whose officers were specially trained and vetted by the United States, including weeklong training at a DEA school in Quantico, Virginia. A former federal police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is no longer with the agency said Reyes Arzate was probably two or three steps down in the command chain from the federal police commissioner. Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said there had always been a problem with the special units: The top commanders refused to submit to background or polygraph checks, even though low-level agents were vetted. What is startling is the length and depth of Reyes Arzate's collusion with the Beltran Leyva gang, which has built a reputation of specializing in corrupting or bribing law enforcement officials. Beyond giving the drug trafficker detailed advice on how to evade the DEA investigation, the commander passed on to him fresh information given to him by the U.S. agency. FILE - Alleged drugdealer Alfredo Beltran Leyva is showed to the media by members of the Mexican Army in Mexico City, on January 21, 2008, after being captured in Culiacan, in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, along with three other members of his gang. An unidentified confidential source cited in the indictment said Reyes Arzate had directly passed tips to Arturo Beltran Leyva, the cartel boss who was killed in 2009. That meant that Reyes Arzate had been a cartel mole in police agencies for at least seven years. The cartel even killed a DEA informant based on information supplied by Reyes Arzate. It raised questions about how Mexican authorities could possibly have missed such longstanding, outrageous corruption. Still, it's not the first time Mexico has failed to detect such deep corruption. The indictment comes about a week after the attorney general for the Mexican state of Nayarit was arrested at the U.S. border on drug charges. Edgar Veytia was charged in the United States with conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to the U.S. from January 2013 to last month, while he was chief law enforcement officer in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit. The revelations about two such-high-ranking officers could fuel continuing tensions between Mexico and the United States.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' Al-Qaida Recruitment in Syria May Jump Rebel commanders and opposition activists are warning that jihadist recruitment of Syrian fighters is likely to jump in the coming months because of the collapse of some moderate militias and a shake-up of others in the wake of a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive in northern Syria. Al-Nusra has pursued a stealthier approach in Syria than its jihadist rival, alternately intermingling with other rebel militias and assisting them when more is to be gained or turning on them and seeking to dominate when circumstances change. FILE - This image posted on the Twitter page of Nusra Front, April 25, 2015, shows Nusra Front fighters in the town of Jisr al-Shughour, Idlib province, Syria. Battlefield effectiveness Jabhat al-Nusra and ally Ahrar al-Sham, a hardline Islamist faction al-Qaida veterans were instrumental in forming, have legitimacy among Syrian rebels, not so much for ideological reasons but because of their effectiveness on the battlefield, say rebel commanders. Redeployment into Aleppo The redeployment back into Aleppo came as the Russian-backed Assad offensive unfolded last month in northern Syria. Al-Nusra fighters set up checkpoints to protect larger incoming conveys. The group also expropriated several large buildings and warehouses in rebel-held districts of Aleppo for use as offices and barracks. Stalls are seen on a street beside damaged buildings in the rebel held al-Shaar neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, Feb. 10, 2016. Political activists quickly raised an alarm about the large presence of al-Nusra fighters, arguing it would make more sense to have them on the outskirts of the city if they were there to combat the Assad offensive in the suburbs of Aleppo. Anger beyond borders The anger can be heard in southern Turkish border towns. His words were greeted with vigorous nods by a small crowd of Syrians.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry reported Monday that the aircraft carrier and five warships sailed 90 nautical miles south of Taiwan, a self-governing island claimed by China. Beijing said it was conducting a routine training exercise. China has previously accused U.S. warships of making provocative passes through the South China Sea. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the U.S. recognizes lawful uses of the sea, and that the same rights apply to the U.S., China and other nations. Earlier this month, a Chinese naval vessel seized an U.S. Navy underwater glider that the U.S. said was conducting oceanic research in international waters off the Philippines. The U.S. called the seizure illegal and made a diplomatic protest. China returned the glider five days later. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea.

       " {'content': \" OAS Call for Venezuelan Suspension Draws Mixed Reaction OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro on Tuesday released a 75-page report accusing Venezuela of violating the rights of its people, including by ignoring the results of 2015 legislative elections and by incarcerating political opponents. Such actions conflict with the standards of the Inter-American Democratic Charter that Venezuela has signed. FILE - Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary-General Luis Almagro addresses the audience during an official visit to Honduras, in Tegucigalpa, Jan. 17, 2017. In a letter accompanying the report to the OAS governing body, the Permanent Council, Almagro said his findings updated a report submitted last May. OAS could suspend Venezuela if at least 22 of the group's 34 active member states agree. A vote has not been scheduled. Oil-rich Venezuela for years doled out petroleum to some of its neighbors at minimal cost, engendering goodwill. But some of that may have ebbed as the country's fortunes plunged along with oil prices in 2014. FILE - Supporters of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro shout as they attend a rally against the application of Organization of American States (OAS) democratic charter, in Caracas, Venezuela, June 23, 2016. The rise of some right-leaning governments in the region also has diminished support for Maduro. Since becoming president in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, he has charged that Venezuela has been the target of an imperialist, capitalist United States. He has steadily amassed power, taking control of the judiciary and trying to block the National Assembly, as well as stymying efforts for a recall referendum. FILE - An anti-government protester is detained by Bolivarian National Police blocking protesters from reaching the headquarters of the national electoral body, CNE, to demand a recall referendum against President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, May 18, 2016. Suspension wouldn't bring measures such as economic sanctions, he noted. The OAS report represents a broadening acknowledgement of Venezuela's slide from democracy, said Angel Medina Davis, president of the Latin American Parliament, Venezuela chapter. He also noted Venezuela's December suspension from the South American regional economic bloc Mercosur for failing to address human rights and trade standards in its national laws. Venezuelan elections for state governors were set for late 2016 but postponed and not yet rescheduled, while the country's presidential election is to take place in December 2018.

       " {'content': ' Vietnam: Lack of Credit Cards Not Stopping Pursuit of E-commerce When it comes to e-commerce, Vietnam is somewhat perplexing to observers. Many Vietnamese love to buy things from the internet, and yet the country seems to lack a key ingredient for online shopping: credit cards. Concerns about security and transaction fees deter both buyers and sellers. Among Vietnamese who go online, 61 percent prefer to pay with cash, according to market researcher Nielsen. Buy online, pay with cash For comparison purposes, consider an online transaction in the United States. A person could go to Etsy.com to buy a notebook, enter his credit card details, and have the U.S. Postal Service ship the book to his house. By contrast, a Vietnamese would go to Vatgia.com to find the notebook, have the vendor drive it by motorbike to his house, and then pay in cash. This method solves two problems for Vietnam. The first is confidence in payment, which is done physically rather than electronically. The second is delivery; merchants tend to use their own motorbike fleets because the postal system is notoriously unreliable and few Vietnamese have mailboxes. Mobile drives growth Nielsen reported in August that 58 percent of Vietnamese internet users shop online with their mobile phones, compared with a global average of 44 percent. Mobile shopping here is likely to beat rates in developed countries like the United States, where the recent unveiling of Apple Pay stirred questions about whether people would warm to the idea of shopping on their phones. The New York Times reported in September that Americans use mobile devices for just 11 percent of e-commerce spending. Phones are vital in Vietnam -- where mobile subscriptions outnumber people -- because fewer citizens have computers, and most are not entering their payment information anyway. Nation of entrepreneurs Despite the dearth of credit cards, Vietnam is a prime target for e-commerce because it is both a nation full of internet fanatics and a very mercantile society. Vietnamese people have a reputation for entrepreneurship. Not only does this college student shop online -- as it turned out, she also sells her own products. My Khanh uploads pictures of her wares, mostly clothes and handicrafts, to Facebook. After buyers contact her, they meet to complete the transaction. With at least 22 million users out of a population 90 million, Facebook in Vietnam is popular for online shopping. But plenty of indigenous sites have popped up, including Zalora, Tiki, Mua Chung, and Lazada, which is the 15th most popular website in the country. That follows a trend across Asia-Pacific, according to Dezan Shira & Associates.',\n",

       " {'content': \" Hopes Fade for Cambodia Winning US Debt Relief, Analysts Say Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's recent plea for relief from decades-old debt to the United States appears to have little chance of success, regional analyst say. Cambodians, they say, would be better off seeking to restructure the debt, easing the repayment burden. But Hun Sen is sticking with his mantra and has repeatedly noted the debt issue in public since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in November. Cambodia racked-up $278 million in U.S. loans under the Lon Nol government in the 1970s, whose efforts to defeat the Khmer Rouge were undermined by gross corruption within his own administration. U.S. records say the loans were for food and other agricultural goods. But the amount has gone up sharply over the years due to interest. Cambodia now owes the U.S. about $505 million, all in arrears with a concessional three percent interest rate, which is below market rates. Last debt talks in 2011 Local residents buy fresh vegetables at a morning market in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Nov. 8, 2015. With interest accumulated over the years, Cambodia today owes the U.S. about half a billion dollars. In 2008 testimony before Congress on the debt, U.S. officials said they had negotiated for several years with the Hun Sen government to work out a payment schedule but to no avail. U.S. and World Bank officials have said Cambodia doesn't meet World Bank standards for debt forgiveness. Importantly, Congress must agree to write off debts for countries that are able to pay, as Cambodia is. Cambodia does not suffer from the same poverty levels as it once did. It was recently promoted to the ranks of the lower-middle income countries and despite this, the U.S. allocates an average of about $70 million a year in direct foreign aid. It has committed $78 million for 2017. Subtle approach urged Billy Chia-Lung Tai, an independent human rights consultant at CL Consulting, urged Cambodians to think carefully on this issue, even though they can argue the debt is the result of U.S. backing for the weak Lon Nol government and Washington's bombing in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Hun Sen began his push for debt relief in 2002 when the Chinese wrote off debts incurred by the Khmer Rouge during their 1975-79 rule. But Russia has also balked at canceling $1.3 billion worth of loans made during the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia in the 1980s. Ongoing debate Sambo Manara, a history lecturer with Pannasastra University said it remains unclear whether the U.S. money was debt or humanitarian aid because it arrived during a difficult period in Cambodia's history, during a civil war, and as the Khmer Rouge militants were threatening the government. Analysts said there were several other reasons why President Trump is unlikely to listen. Molyny Pann contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Fears Grow Turkey Is Getting Sucked into Syrian Conflict Turkish media report thousands more soldiers will be sent into Syria, as Turkish forces struggle to recapture the strategically important town of al-Bab from so-called Islamic State. Last month, 16 Turkish soldiers were killed in one attack in al-Bab, where jihadists increasingly are using suicide bombers and truck bombs in the fight over the town. al-Bab, Syria He argued the battle for the town has become politically important. Turkish military vehicles drive by Free Syrian Army fighters, backed by Turkey, in the Syrian rebel-held town of al-Rai as they head towards the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, Jan. 9, 2017. The Turkish Army launched Operation Euphrates Shield last August, ostensibly to support the Free Syrian Army, or FSA, the rebel group fighting with Turkish forces in Syria. Retired Brigadier General Haldun Solmazturk heads the 21st Century Turkey Institute, an Ankara-based research group. He said the battle for al-Bab has revealed crucial shortcomings in the FSA. With the Turkish military ravaged by ongoing purges of its ranks since a failed coup in July, there are questions over its ability to step up its commitment in Syria, warned Solmazturk. Image made from militant video posted online by the Aamaq News Agency, a media arm of the Islamic State group, Jan. 9, 2017, purports to show the moment of a Turkish missile strike, in the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, in Aleppo province, Syria. Analysts say a sign of Ankara's growing frustrations is the fact it chided Washington for failing to provide air support for the Turkish military operation in al-Bab. There is likely to be a price for that support. Operation Euphrates Shield targets the Syrian Kurdish militia the YPG along with Islamic State. Turkey says both groups are terrorist organizations; but, the YPG is seen by Turkey's Western allies and Moscow as important to fighting IS. Last week, Moscow and Ankara announced they would coordinate their airstrikes in Syria. Sunday, military leaders from 14 countries in the Middle East and Africa offered support for Turkey at a meeting in Riyadh, but did not specify what form it would entail. Despite such steps, concerns remain over the ongoing Syrian operation. Turkey has been vague about its objectives in Syria, saying only that it aims to remove the threat of terrorism from its border. Analysts say the main motive of Turkey's military intervention in Syria could be to give Ankara a say over that country's future, but warn Turkey could end up paying a considerable price.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" US Marine Appeals Murder Conviction in Death of Transgender Filipino A U.S. Marine is appealing his conviction in the death of a transgender Filipino woman, his lawyer said Wednesday. Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton was found guilty of homicide in December for killing Jennifer Laude after he found out she was a transgender woman. Judge Roline Ginez Jabalde had sentenced Pemberton to six to 12 years in prison, with credit for his confinement, and ordered him to pay nearly $100,000 in damages to the Laude family. On Wednesday, Pemberton asked a regional trial court judge in Olongapo, northwest of Manila, to reverse his conviction, and sought bail and a reduction of his six- to 12-year jail term, said Rowena Garcia-Flores, the Marine's lawyer. Flores said she would insist that Pemberton did not kill Laude in a motel room after they met in a disco bar in October 2014 and that his sentence should be eased because he surrendered to authorities. The court will start to hear Pemberton's appeal on Thursday. In December, Jabalde convicted Pemberton of homicide, not the more serious charge of murder as prosecutors and the family sought, and sentenced him to a lighter jail term. She said she downgraded the charge because conditions such as cruelty and treachery had not been proven. FILE - U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, third left, is escorted into the courtroom for his scheduled trial, March 23, 2015, at Olongapo city, Zambales province, northwest of Manila, Philippines. The judge said in her decision that Pemberton did not set out to kill anyone, but instead, in a drunken moment of anger, put Laude in a chokehold, then drowned her in a toilet after he discovered she had a male sex organ. Our fight was not a waste . He will be imprisoned. A woman pays her respects to slain transgender Jennifer Laude inside a funeral home in Olongapo city, north of Manila October 21, 2014. Philippine President Benigno Aquino rejected on Monday calls to tear up the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United S The killing sparked anger in the Philippines and reignited calls by left-wing groups and nationalists for an end to America's military presence in the country at a time when the United States is reasserting its dominance in Asia and Manila has turned to Washington for support amid an escalating territorial dispute with China. Pemberton, 21, an anti-tank missile operator from New Bedford, Massachusetts, has been detained at a compound guarded by Philippine and American security personnel, at the main military camp in metropolitan Manila, and not in a civilian jail.

The event was held to share insights and success stories on applied innovations to address HIV and AIDS. The conference enabled medical researchers and scholars from across Africa to exchange notes on what is being done to fight the spread of HIV on the continent. One of the major highlights of the conference was a revelation that the number of medical graduates in HIV/AIDS is increasing in Africa. The chairman of the conference, professor James Hakim, said a lot had improved since the introduction of antiretroviral drugs in Africa but added that much remains to be done. We still do not have any cure. Although there are a lot of programs that are looking for cure, there is none, Hakim said. Africa bears the biggest effects of HIV with more than two-thirds of global infections being on the continent. He said the program ensures innovations to address HIV and AIDS in Africa and, down the road, will hopefully lead to an AIDS-free generation.',\n",

       " {'content': ' New Jersey Maintenance Workers Among Powerball Winners A group of 16 maintenance workers from a county government garage in New Jersey share one of three winning tickets in the $448 million Powerball lottery jackpot, their boss said on Friday. New Jersey Lottery spokeswoman Judith Drucker said on Friday the owners of the two winning tickets sold in New Jersey, including the Ocean County group, have not come forward. The third winner was in Minnesota, where he held a press conference on Thursday. Pine said the winners would go public next week, although they have not yet decided when they will validate their ticket. He added that all 16 have come to work since winning the Powerball drawing on Wednesday evening. Winning tickets were sold at an Acme Markets store in the Jersey shore town of Little Egg Harbor and at a Super Stop & Shop supermarket in South Brunswick, said Judith Drucker, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Lottery. Paul White (L), 45, from Ham Lake, Minnesota, stands with his partner Kim VanReese (C) and co-worker Nancy Bowen (R) as he holds a check for his $149.4 million portion of a $448.4 million Powerball jackpot prize at a news conference at Minnesota State Lot The only confirmed winner is Minnesota engineer Paul White, 45, who was introduced on Thursday. He said he was so excited about winning he ran around the office of the Minneapolis contracting firm where he works. White, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter, savored his win at a news conference at lottery headquarters by recalling when he first realized he hit it big. He jumped up and ran around the office, and asked several people to look at the ticket to verify the Powerball number of 32 and numbers 5-25-30-58-59. He then went to the Minnesota Lottery office, where he chose to take a cash payment of $86 million, or $58.3 million after taxes, from his $149 million share of the total jackpot. The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million. The largest jackpot in history stands at $656 million, won in the Mega Millions lottery in March 2012. That prize was split among winners in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois. The biggest single-winner Powerball jackpot, of $590.5 million, was claimed in June by an 84-year-old Florida woman who opted for a lump-sum payment of nearly $371 million rather than the 30-year option. Powerball tickets are sold in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five states - Kansas, Maryland, Delaware, North Dakota and Ohio - allow the winners to remain anonymous, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.',\n",

Ukraine Polls He expressed disappointment that Russia not only did not use its leverage to forestall the votes but that Russian media even attempted to legitimize them. He also expressed concern over apparent efforts to disrupt Ukraine's presidential elections, scheduled for May 25, saying that international efforts should now be centered on allowing Ukraine to hold a free and fair poll. Carney gave credit to Kyiv authorities for what he said were efforts to address grievances of residents of Ukraine's east through negotiations. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for an end to the undermining of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Pleas for Russian troops, annexation FILE - Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, separatist mayor of Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine, holds up a referendum ballot. Speaking a day after controversial referendums in eastern Ukraine, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov described Ukrainian troops there as occupiers. Pro-Russian separatists in Luhansk region followed suit, the Associated Press reported. Denis Pushilin, senior member of the pro-Russia separatist rebellion leadership, meets with journalists in Donetsk, May 12, 2014. Pushilin said Ukraine, Belarus and Russia - states that formed the core of the now defunct Soviet Union - belonged in a restored historic union. The results of the Donetsk and Luhansk votes should be implemented peacefully, Russia said earlier, without saying what further action it might take. Kyiv, EU denounce votes Secessionist referendum official Alexander Malyhin holds a document as he speaks to journalists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk May 12, 2014. The European Union has also condemned the votes as illegal. European Union foreign ministers added two Crimean companies and 13 people to the bloc's sanctions list, EU diplomats said. These are in addition to 48 Russians and Ukrainians who have already been targeted with EU asset freezes and visa bans. The EU ministers also hinted on Monday that any disruption of elections in Ukraine on May 25 could trigger new economic sanctions against Russia. But the EU remains far behind the United States in the severity of the sanctions it has imposed on Russia. Some European governments fear tough trade sanctions on Russia could undermine their own economies, just recovering from the financial crisis, and provoke Russian retaliation. Coup accusations FILE - Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov Turchynov said the Kremlin was trying to disrupt a presidential election scheduled for May 25 which is taking center stage in a confrontation pitting Moscow along with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine against the government in Kyiv and its Western backers. Ukraine's May 25 election is intended to secure democratic continuity and legitimacy after pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February, and Western governments have threatened more sanctions in the vital areas of energy, financial services and engineering if Moscow disrupts the vote. Separatists to form own army Following Sunday's referendums, separatist leaders in Donetsk say they will form their own army and expect all forces affiliated with Kyiv to leave the region. A pro-Russian gunman stands guard outside an administrative building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk May 12, 2014. Analysts say they fear the authorities are likely to rely on irregulars more and that the fighting could spread beyond the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which voted Sunday. Luhansk separatist leader Valery Bolotov said now that the plebiscites are over, his pro-Russian militiamen as well as separatists from Donetsk will start turning their attention elsewhere to help other regions agitate for a break from Ukraine. He said separatists will not enter into any talks with Kyiv and that the only negotiations currently are about prisoner and hostage exchanges. TV wars Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged Western ambassadors on Monday to base the reports they write for their countries about the crisis in Ukraine on what they see on Russian television. Lavrov accused Ukraine of blocking Russian television broadcasts onto its territory and, echoing charges by Kyiv about Moscow, said the fellow former Soviet republic's media were broadcasting lies about the crisis. Russian media, most under direct or indirect government control, are widely viewed in the West as distorting news about events in Ukraine both for internal and external consumption. Moscow turns up pressure on Kyiv Russian state-controlled gas company Gazprom has reiterated its threat to stop supplying Ukraine with gas if it does not pay in advance for June deliveries, Russian news agencies reported on Monday. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said Gazprom will present Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz with a bill for June on Tuesday, demanding payment by June 2, the reports said. He said the amount of gas to be supplied would be zero if no payment is made. Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $3.51 billion and has warned in recent weeks that it would demand pre-payment for gas from next month. President Vladimir Putin warned European gas customers last month that deliveries could be disrupted if Gazprom cuts supplies to transit nation Ukraine.

       " {'content': ' White House Options Grim as Syria Spirals Downward The White House still has no effective plan to stop it and there are no good options either, experts said. Moscow marked the anniversary on Friday by signaling it will ramp up its bombardments alongside the Syrian government against Aleppo, the last stronghold of opposition rebels. More than 250,000 people are trapped in the ravaged city, where the bombings have decimated critical sites, including water supplies, refugee camps, hospitals and humanitarian aid supplies. The strikes even targeted an underground playground, according to the White House. Humanitarian aid Yet the White House has continued to express hope that Moscow would press the Assad government to uphold a cease-fire and allow the flow of humanitarian aid to terrorized populations in Aleppo and elsewhere. A U.S.-Russia brokered cease-fire fell apart last month, after Russia and Syria launched the air offensive against opposition rebels in a bid to push them out of major urban areas. The bombardments have pushed diplomatic engagement between Moscow and Washington to the brink. Syrian civil defense volunteers, known as the White Helmets, pass the body of a boy after he was pulled from the rubble following a government forces airstrike on the rebel-held al-Shaer neighborhood of Aleppo, Sept. 27, 2016. A telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Lavrov on Friday yielded no progress. No major shift by US The White House also has offered no indication it plans a major shift in its approach. Former U.S. ambassador to Syria Robert Ford predicted there will be no major breakthrough between the U.S. and Russia to solve the crisis because they have fundamentally different views. Ford, who served in the diplomatic role from 2011-2014, is currently a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. The Russian diplomat also charged more rebel groups are aligning themselves with terror organizations. People dig in the rubble in an ongoing search for survivors at a site hit previously by an airstrike in the rebel-held Tariq al-Bab neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, Sept. 26, 2016. Terror vs. opposition groups While Russia has said it is fighting terror groups in Syria, the U.S. has accused Moscow of primarily targeting local opposition groups and civilians instead. One expert suggested the U.S. has done too little. In addition, the engagement with Russia must end, Casagrande argued. While Kerry has done everything possible to reach a negotiated solution, the effort ignores important realities, said Anthony Cordesman, Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Experts also said the U.S. must do more to bolster opposition groups in Syria before they are forced to turn to al-Qaida groups for help in breaking the siege. The U.S. needs a more assertive approach and to provide opposition groups with a surge of assistance, said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Experts agreed, however, there is no one good or easy solution to solving the Syrian crisis. Nike Ching at the State Department contributed to this report.',\n",

Calls for resignation Meanwhile, two major European football associations called on Blatter to resign, ahead of presidential elections planned for Friday. UEFA President Michel Platini addresses a news conference after a UEFA meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, May 28, 2015. The president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), French football legend Michel Platini, spoke openly about the FIFA scandal and took issue with Blatter's refusal to resign. According to Platini, Blatter refused, arguing that it was too late, since the electing congress was about to start. The German Football Association (DFB) has also demanded Blatter's resignation, citing the credibility issue with him. Blatter rejected their demands. Sponsors' reactions Also, sponsors are calling for football's governing body FIFA to make changes while its regional federations debate the future of its often-criticized leader.

Blatter is expected to win a fifth term in Friday's election against Jordan's Prince Ali. But The Football Federation of Australia, FFA, which has supported Blatter since he first assumed the presidency in 1998, said it would support the prince this year. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Thursday that whoever serves as FIFA's next president should take steps to ensure future World Cup host cities focus on basic human rights. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said FIFA needs to learn from the Olympic movement's experience and become more transparent if it is to regain its credibility. In 1998, the IOC was caught in its own bribes-for-votes scandal involving the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The U.S. economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2016. But economists say first quarter estimates tend to be notoriously low for a number of reasons.

Jordan confirmed Wednesday that the pilot was being held. The F-16 fighter jet he was flying as part of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group went down near the rebel stronghold of Raqqa, in northern Syria. The U.S. military acknowledged that the plane crashed, but it denied a claim by Islamic State militants that they shot it down. Jordan is one of several countries in the region participating in the air campaign against the group. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Thursday announced an agreement between the two countries to expand cooperation in fighting the Islamic State group. In the last year, the extremist militants overran large areas of northern and western Iraq and launched an offensive in Syria along the Turkish border. Abadi said Turkey and Iraq would collaborate on military, intelligence, weapons and training. Therefore, we need international support to fight them, and we've asked for it. The countries both have vocal Kurdish minorities. Despite long-standing movements for independence, they have become a central force in countering the Islamic state with their militias. Davutoglu indicated Turkey had helped train Kurdish peshmerga fighters in Iraq and would continue supporting the country against the militant group.\",\n",

Four other carts followed, laden with days-old corpses from air strikes that the men said killed 21 relatives and neighbors in an area Islamic State militants controlled earlier in the week. A father's loss Ayed, a 40-year-old laborer, pulled back a blanket to show his only son, 3-year-old Ahmed, lying lifeless with his eyes closed and a big gash in his right cheek. Fifteen minutes later the strikes hit. Relatives carry the bodies of civilians killed in air strikes during a battle between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants, in Mosul, Iraq, March 17, 2017. The bodies had begun to smell, but it had only just become safe enough to leave the district, now cleared of the militants, and bring the carts to Mosul airport, where a bus might be able to take them to the nearest village for burial, he said. Reuters counted about 15 corpses on the carts. Air strikes miss IS, kill civilians They are among the latest victims caught in the crossfire of an intensifying battle between U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants holed up the center of Mosul, their last major stronghold in Iraq. Rights groups have expressed concern over the mounting civilian death toll, as Islamic State fights from homes and densely populated areas, a threat the Iraqi military and U.S.-led coalition have been countering with heavy weaponry to support troops on the ground. Families fleeing Mosul in recent weeks have talked of high numbers of civilians killed by air strikes, and said that in many cases Islamic State fighters have slipped away by the time the bombs hit. On Friday, even as Ayed and his helpers waited with their carts, helicopters fired at positions in Mosul and forces further back launched Grad missiles into the city. Relatives carry the bodies of civilians killed in air strikes during a battle between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants, in Mosul, Iraq, March 17, 2017. Many reports of civilian deaths The New York-based watchdog said Iraqi Interior Ministry units had recently used nonprecision rockets in west Mosul. Separately, the United Nations says it has received many reports of civilian deaths in air strikes. Civilian death estimates vary widely The U.S.-led coalition backing Iraqi forces with air power and military advisers admits causing unintentional civilian deaths. This month the U.S. military said the total number of civilians killed by the coalition since the start of operations against the militant group in 2014 in both Iraq and Syria was 220. That estimate is lower than those of some monitoring groups. Airwars, a journalist-run project to monitor civilian casualties, says at least 2,590 civilians have likely been killed by coalition actions since 2014, including scores in Mosul in the first week of March alone. Coalition forces go slow Coalition and Iraqi forces have mostly been careful to avoid civilian deaths, a reason military officials said they slowed some assaults in eastern Mosul last year. But the west, which houses the narrow-alleyed Old City, has been a tougher fight, and Islamic State have pinned down Iraqi forces for days on end in some areas without significant advances. The level of destruction is visibly greater, with dozens of buildings flattened and large holes in roads from air strikes.

       " {'content': \" Trump's First Big Immigration Op: 680 Arrested and Lots of Questions The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) says it rounded up 680 undocumented immigrants last week in enforcement actions in multiple locations around the U.S. This is the first big ICE operation of the Donald Trump presidency, and it has sparked a lot of fear and questions. What actually happened? More than 680 undocumented people were taken into custody by ICE in Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, San Antonio and New York City. There also were reports of arrests in other locations. DHS is the parent agency of ICE. Who was targeted? Over the course of that week, immigrant protection groups got an unusual number of calls from panicking immigrants reporting arrests in homes and at workplaces. A number of groups, led by United We Dream, held a press call February 10, alerting the media to what they said was a new era of persecution under Trump. They shared reports of roadside checkpoints and apartment building sweeps. People participate in a protest against President Donald Trump's immigration policy and the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in New York City, Feb. 11, 2017. But the evidence provided by hers and other groups was largely anecdotal. Amid the flurry of reports, ICE and DHS felt compelled to issue a number of statements, stressing that the enforcement operations were routine. What set the stage for this? He tweeted on February 12 that he is doing just that. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true thisSnippet = (d.getElementsByClassName ? eval.innerHTML = userInput; return; var tag = elm.tagName.toLowerCase(); return; js.id = sId; firstJs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, firstJs); thisSnippet.appendChild(bquote); window.twttr.widgets.load(); //fix twitter bug rendering multiple embeds per tweet. Can be deleted after Twitter fix the issue var par = e.target.parentElement; //this is duplicate embed, delete it par.removeChild(e.target); renderTweets(); render(); //else //liveblog, ajax // render(); As a result, widespread deportations were expected and feared. Reports of the deportation of the mother of two American children further fueled fears. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, went in for a routine check with ICE on February 8. She had checked in with immigration authorities every year since 2008, when she was stopped for using a fake Social Security number. In past visits, she answered questions that were put to her and went home. This time she was taken into custody. The family of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos stands behind her attorney, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, as he speaks in front of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. Garcia de Rayos was deported Feb. 9, 2017. Was this round-up routine? To show that this roundup was routine, ICE pointed to several nationwide enforcement operations, often called Operation Cross Check, it has conducted since 2011. President Obama issued guidelines that year specifying that removal efforts should be focused on people who were a threat to public safety. The operations include: Were there indications that these operations were not routine? Yes. When Secretary Kelly said that 75 percent of the people apprehended in the enforcement operation had criminal records, he also was saying that a quarter of the people picked up were not criminals. That those people were apprehended, likely caught up in a net thrown for someone else, was a break with the past. During the Obama administration, ICE was instructed to pick up only people who were targeted in advance and not just anybody swept up in a raid. This time seems to have been different. FILE - Immigration activists march in a rally against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) raids and deportation of immigrants near the downtown Los Angeles Federal Building, Jan. 26, 2016. Lawyers have filed suit on his behalf. Another area where there seems to have been a change in policy is an Obama-era rule that ICE agents would only target deportation orders dating from the beginning of 2014. Rayos, mentioned above, would have had a deportation order dating from 2008. His executive order would indicate the bar has moved. Some 11 million people in the United States are in that group. What now? Pro-immigrant groups believe the roundups were intended to strike fear into the heart of the immigrant community, and that they have succeeded. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has requested guidance from ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Bahrain to Put Activist on Trial on Defamation Charge Pro-democracy campaigner Nabeel Rajab, one of the highest profile activists in the Arab world, is to go on trial in Bahrain accused of insulting the Interior and Defense Ministries, his supporters said on Thursday. While the Public Prosecution did not name Rajab on a statement carried on the official news agency announcing a trial on October 19, the Interior Ministry identified him when he was arrested on October 2. Rajab took a leading role in the 2011 mass Shi'ite-led demonstrations demanding reforms in the Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab kingdom that were inspired by other pro-democracy uprisings of the Arab Spring. If convicted, Rajab, founder of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, could find himself back in prison just months after completing a two years sentence in May for organizing and participating in illegal protests. Fellow activists who have maintained his official twitter account during past detentions confirmed the trial date. Rajab was detained for questioning shortly after returning to Bahrain from a trip abroad. Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, put down the protests but has since struggled to resolve political deadlock between the government and the opposition. Many Shi'ites complain of political and economic discrimination, a charge the authorities deny. Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail last year in a separate case over a tweet criticizing the prime minister, the king's uncle. The ruling was overturned, but only after Rajab had already served his sentence.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Erdogan Signals Possible Snap Election His comments come as talks about forming a coalition government drag on in Ankara. His supporters, meanwhile, are calling for the main pro-Kurdish opposition party, whose electoral performance last month denied the ruling party a majority, to be banned, accusing it of being a stalking horse for terrorists. Erdoğan raised the possibility of a snap election in remarks to reporters while heading to Indonesia, noting that Turkey will need to return to the polls if ongoing government coalition talks fail. He also made clear his own dislike of coalitions, pointing out that they tend to be short-lived and that Turkey, as it pursues a two-front war against Islamic State militants and Kurdish separatists, needs a strong government. Commentators and opposition politicians are accusing the Turkish leader of pursuing a strategy geared to obstruct the formation of a coalition government. Turkish police officers carry the coffin of slain police officers Serdar Kazar and Isa Ipek, killed in an attack by Kurdish rebels overnight, in the the city of Adana, southern Turkey, July 31, 2015. Pro-Kurdish party Among the issues raised with the ambassadors are moves in parliament to lift immunity protections on two HDP co-chairs, Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ, paving the way for them to be prosecuted, according to party officials. Turkish police arrest a protester chanting slogans in Istanbul after he and others tried to stage a march to denounce the deaths of a Monday explosion in the Turkish town of Suruc near the Syrian border, July 21, 2015. On social media forums, AKP supporters and Twitter trolls have been urging the HDP be banned. Its leaders say it's part of a coordinated campaign of intimidation against the pro-Kurdish party. Speaking to the media Friday, Demirtaş urged the government to cease bombing PKK bases and to renew peace talks with the separatists. Kurdish separatists Turkish defense officials say at least 190 militants have been killed in the airstrikes and more than 300 wounded. The PKK has responded with the shootings and attacks that have killed a dozen members of the security forces and one civilian. Damaging the HDP Demirtaş, a former human rights lawyer, led the HDP into the parliamentary elections. Campaigning on a progressive agenda, the HDP broadened its appeal beyond traditional Kurdish supporters, winning enough seats to deprive the AKP of a parliamentary majority for the first time in more than a decade. Turkish government leaders have maintained a drum beat all week against the pro-Kurdish party. Airstrikes to continue Speaking Friday, Davutoğlu said violence would abate in Turkey when all armed groups quit the country, vowing to continue security operations against both Islamic extremists and Kurdish militants. He dismissed opposition allegations that the abrupt launching of attacks on IS and the PKK are linked to domestic politics or electoral calculations.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Study: Terrorists Usually Don't Claim Responsibility for Attacks Three weeks after EgyptAir Flight 804 crashed into the sea killing all 66 people on board, several theories abound about what happened. It was terrorism. It was mechanical failure, or, as some claim, it could have been a meteor collision. In the days after the crash, many people waited for a militant group to boast it was responsible. After a week, many analysts said continued silence indicated that it may not have been terrorism. Why would terrorists not claim responsibility for such a devastating attack? A relative of the victims of the EgyptAir flight 804 that crashed, reacts as she makes a phone call at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside of Paris, Thursday, May 19, 2016. Why not boast? After the March bombings in Brussels, Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for the attack, as they had last year prior after the Paris incidents. For the militants, these attacks, that altogether killed 162 people, were meant to be spectacles, according to Dalia Ghanem Yazbeck of the Carnegie Middle East Center. She says groups also sometimes have reasons not to claim credit for attacks, such as to avoid retaliation. In other cases, militant groups simply do not need the publicity in areas where they are already powerful. A destroyed van is pictured near a Turkish police bus which was targeted in a bomb attack in a central Istanbul district, Turkey, June 7, 2016. Instead, they argue, claims of responsibility are strategic decisions based on expected political fallout, with little relation to ideology. Contrary to popular belief, he adds, while extreme violence against civilians does attract interest from the most extreme of extremists, it also can quickly build enemies. The international coalition against Islamic State is weakening the organization, while other groups, like al-Nusra in Syria, an al-Qaida offshoot, are growing partially by presenting themselves as fighters in a war, rather than killers of civilians. Leaders and followers Within militant organizations, there is a stark difference in the expected behaviors of leaders compared to followers, according to Abrahms. And while followers may want to claim all attacks, decision-makers are often thinking ahead. For example, an attack on a civilian aircraft could be part of a larger string of attacks that would be threatened if the perpetrators were known.

Additionally, attacks on military targets are often claimed by more experienced fighters, according to Abrahms, while newbies may be more impressed with gore. The Islamic State leadership, he adds, may ultimately meet its demise as a result of its bloody and ruthless image, which attracts equally ruthless followers.\",\n",

He noted that all those detained Monday are suspected of belonging to an Islamic State cell. Istanbul Gov. Vasip Sahin, left, accompanied by Police Chief Mustafa Caliskan, talks to the media during a news conference regarding the arrest of a suspect of New Year's nightclub attack in Istanbul, Jan. 17, 2017. The governor said Masharipov's arrest was part of a well-coordinated operation. The Istanbul governor said more than 2,000 police officers were involved in what he called a difficult and complex investigation. The capture of the suspect alive also is seen as an important breakthrough. Experts say that Islamic State suspects usually kill themselves prior to capture. Investigators are expected to focus on what assistance Masharipov may have received. Turkish media, citing intelligence sources, say the manhunt for Masharipov has revealed as many as 20 Islamic State networks within Turkey.

Turkish security forces and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu had faced growing criticism over the failure to find the attacker, given that a clear image of the suspect existed. That criticism was stoked by the threat of further attacks by Islamic State. A video purported to be put out by Islamic State currently is circulating on social media in Turkey. In it, the group specifically targets Istanbul. Analysts warn Turkey is paying a price for its past policy of offering broad support to any group fighting the Syrian regime.

From January 1 through September 25, 302,149 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea, a drop of more than 40 percent from the same period last year, the IOM, the largest migration organization in the world, reported. Refugee deaths rose, however, with the IOM recording 3,501 refugee and migrant fatalities through September 25, up nearly 20 percent from the same period last year. In the latest tragedy, a boat overloaded with at least 600 migrants headed for Europe capsized off the coast of Egypt last week, killing at least 170 people. Last year more than 1 million refugees and migrants fled to Europe, as the conflict in Syria spurred the largest migration crisis in the world since World War II. Syrian refugees accounted for the largest group of migrants seeking asylum in Europe, followed by migrants from Afghanistan and Iraq.

Coffins containing the bodies of Afghan national Army (ANA) soldiers killed in April 21's attack on an army headquarters are lined up in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, April 22, 2017. The TV station also named the provinces to which the bodies of the victims have been dispatched for burials. Possible impact on morale cited Government officials privately have insisted that releasing the death toll could undermine the morale of the Afghan army battling a resurgent Taliban. But critics assert the government was disrespecting the slain soldiers by withholding the number of casualties. Officials and insurgents say a group of 10 heavily-armed Taliban fighters wearing army uniforms, and accompanying an allegedly wounded soldier, stormed the base and carried out the massacre. The attack mainly targeted a dining hall and mosque deep inside the facility where hundreds of Afghan soldiers were offering special Friday prayers. Afghan soldiers stand guard at the gate of a military base in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, April 21, 2017, after an attack by Taliban suicide bombers and gunmen who entered the compound wearing Afghan army uniforms. Witnesses and security sources said that Taliban assailants drove up to the base in two army vehicles mounted with machine guns, waving fake identification cards and claiming they were bringing back a seriously injured soldier from the frontline. Some of the attackers detonated explosives strapped to their bodies while others were gunned down by Afghan commandos before the hours-long siege ended. Raid renews criticism The carnage prompted the defense minister and the army chief to step down on Monday. President Ashraf Ghani has also removed several corps commanders, including that of the Shaheen Corps, following the attack. The Afghan Taliban released to the media this photo which it said shows the suicide bombers and gunmen who attacked the army base in Mazar-i-Sharif, April 21, 2017. At least four Afghan soldiers are suspected of having helped the attackers but they remain at large, according to officials. American military advisors and trainers were also present at a different location inside the regional military headquarters.\",\n",

International troops stationed in Kosovo include 600 Americans. The concerns about the Russian installation in Serbia is that it could become an outpost for Kremlin spies and, in effect, a command center for Russia's disruptive response to EU enlargement and NATO's expansion in the region. Russia has always supported Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state. Serbian control The State Department's Yee said the United States opposes granting diplomatic status or its equivalent to Russians based in Niš.

(Kane Farabaugh/VOA News) As night fell Monday, dozens of protesters repeatedly defied police orders to stay off the street and stopped traffic on West Florissant Avenue, the scene of riots and looting over the last year. As further unrest marked the anniversary of the shooting death of Michael Brown, some in the crowd, not far from the spot where he was shot, felt the awareness stemming from that incident has empowered them. But for as much change as Shawn welcomes, she said some things have stayed the same. Beefed up police presence The beefed-up police presence in Ferguson came one night after officers shot and seriously wounded an 18-year old suspect they say opened fire on them, leading to charges against the suspect and a state of emergency declared in St. Louis County to stem further violence. Those on the ground in Ferguson for another night of protests shrugged off those concerns. Police gather on street in Ferguson, Missouri, Aug. 10, 2015.

An irate crowd of citizens gathered late Monday at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center for the first city council meeting since the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott and the subsequent series of nightly protests that sometimes turned violent. The shooting was another example of what some people believe is a nationwide pattern of police using excessive force against African Americans. It was the beginning of a period of unrest that has since permeated the city. Police confront protesters blocking a highway during demonstrations following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Sept. 22, 2016. Many at the emotionally charged meeting called for the resignations of city leaders, including Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Police Chief Kerr Putney, who have been roundly criticized for waiting days to release police video of the shooting, fueling the discontent in the community. People are losing their lives, and you are backing these people with these policies. You are on the verge of bringing this fine city to its knees. Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney speaks as city officials, including Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts (R), listen during a news conference following the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Sept. 22, 2016. Call for federal investigation After the meeting, some protesters gathered in the lobby of the Government Center and demanded a federal investigation into the Scott shooting. While the Scott shooting is investigated by local and state officials, it also refocuses the national spotlight on race relations in the country. During the presidential debate, many observers believe Clinton bested Trump on the issue of race. Trump responded by incorrectly blaming Clinton for starting the controversy when she ran against Obama in 2008. Police detain two people during protests following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Sept. 21, 2016. Stop and frisk, which allowed police to search citizens for drugs or weapons, was ruled unconstitutional for targeting minorities. I say nothing because I was able to get him to produce it.

On Thursday, Comey is testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of several congressional panels probing possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials, about his conversations with Trump over the past several months. Here are several excerpts about Comey's recollections, from his expected opening statement to the Senate panel. President Donald Trump, third from right, and first lady Melania Trump, hidden at left, sit down to dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, third from left, and his wife Akie Abe, right, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Feb. 10, 2017. From a one-on-one Jan. 27 dinner with Trump at the White House. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI's traditionally independent status in the executive branch. I added that I was not on anybody's side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the president. I didn't move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. FILE - Then-White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, center, arrives at the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2017. From a Feb. 14 meeting with Trump in the Oval Office at the White House. Trump had fired National Security Advisor Michael Flynn the day before. He repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians but had misled the vice president. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn's departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. FILE - President Donald Trump conducts a phone call in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Jan. 28, 2017. From a March 30 phone call to Comey. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn't find anything, to our having done the work well.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Thai Coup Leaders Tighten Grip The U.S. military has canceled training and readiness exercises with Thailand, as well as a visit to the Asian nation by U.S. Pacific Fleet commander originally scheduled for June, the Pentagon said Saturday. Thai soldiers guard during a protest against the coup in Bangkok, Thailand Saturday, May 24, 2014. Army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the coup Thursday, declared himself acting prime minister Friday and dissolved the Senate on Saturday, has assumed all lawmaking powers. He said the moves are necessary to restore public order and push through political reforms. Soldiers forced those protesters from their camps in the hours after the coup. Thai anti-coup protesters hold up banners during a protest outside a shopping complex in Bangkok, Thailand Saturday, May 24, 2014. The new anti-coup demonstrators managed to foil soldiers who blocked them from marching to the monument Saturday afternoon. When troops cut off a major avenue on the march route, there were brief scuffles. Among those on the streets were Poongsa Poongchan, who said he spontaneously decided to join the march. Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra talks to media during a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand, May 7, 2014. Among those observing the Victory Monument rally was Sean Boonpracong, a former national security adviser in the government of former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Yingluck, whose Peau Thai Party won a landslide victory in the last nation election in 2011, is being detained by the military. The military on Saturday told 35 more people to report to army facilities, going beyond the previous category of political figures and protest leaders. On the list were several intellectuals. Chulalongkorn University political science professor Panitan Wattanayagorn said the summons to writers and academics shows the military is engaging in a more systematic crackdown than it did following the last coup in 2006. With the senate newly dissolved, former lawmaker Dr. Jetn Sirathranont -- who had called on then-Prime Minister Yingluck to resign -- said the general's takeover came as no surprise. He gave it tacit endorsement. The United States has suspended $3.5 million in military aid to Thailand, and says it is reviewing whether to cut another $7 million in assistance. The U.S. State Department also warned U.S. citizens against non-essential travel to the country. The Thai military already had banned Yingluck and more than 150 other political figures from leaving Thailand without permission. It is not clear if the other politicians in custody are being held in the same location. The country's caretaker prime minister, Niwattumrong Boosongpaisan, was among those summoned by military authorities. Until the bloodless coup, he had been in charge of the kingdom on an acting basis after a court ordered Yingluck to step down earlier this month on charges of nepotism. Thailand has been wracked by six months of political disputes and sometimes violent demonstrations. Crisis talks between rival political parties broke down early this past week. Nearly 30 people have been killed during anti-government protests. Thailand's army has staged 12 coups in the last 80 years. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true Error rendering storify. oEval.innerHTML = userInput; return; lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(iframeEle); scriptEle.src = oScript.src; lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(scriptEle); lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(noscriptEle); while ((el = el.parentElement) && !el.classList.contains(cls)); return el; else //liveblog, ajax render(); VOA's Ron Corben in Bangkok contributed to this report, and Jeff Seldin also contributed.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Italy Marks Day of Mourning; Prosecutors Threaten Quake Victims' Families Paintings hang on the walls of the earthquake-damaged church in the village of Santi Lorenzo e Flaviano, central Italy, Aug. 27, 2016. He asked for his full name to be withheld because he had recently renovated his property. House-by-house probe The chief prosecutor of the province of Rieti, Giuseppe Saieva, appears to have little sympathy for traditional arguments about building codes and complaints about the byzantine, slow-moving bureaucracies that homeowners have to battle to get anything done. Firefighters operate a drone to survey quake-damaged buildings in the village of Cossito, central Italy, Aug. 27, 2016. As the prosecutor issued his threats, nine more bodies were dug out by emergency crews from the rubble of Amatrice, which so far has accounted for 230 of those killed midweek. Earlier Saturday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella toured the mainly medieval hilltop stone town to see the damage for himself before traveling to Ascoli Piceno for a funeral held in a sports hall where 35 wooden coffins were lined up. On the top of the coffins were flowers and photographs of those who lost their lives. Promise to rebuild Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi repeated his promise at the funeral to rebuild the shattered communities, but the mayor of Amatrice urged the government not only to rebuild but also not to repeat the snail's-pace postquake reconstructions of recent years. The coffin of Giulia, 9 years old, is carried outside the gymnasium at the end of the state funeral service in Ascoli Piceno, Italy, Aug. 27, 2016. Mourners who packed the sweltering sports hall included many injured in the earthquake. As the bishop spoke, many of the relatives of the dead cried quietly. One woman consoled her husband by rubbing his back gently as he bowed his head. Among the mourners were doctors and nurses who had treated the injured. Outside the packed sports hall, hundreds of locals came to pay their respects. But civil protection experts and geologists say Italy is likely to experience many more high death tolls and quake devastation in the future. A message is seen during the state funeral service of some of the earthquake victims in Ascoli Piceno, Italy, Aug. 27, 2016. Re-evaluation urged He argued that Italians need to rethink what they expect from the government in terms of rebuilding damaged towns and homes. Currently, the vast majority of Italians do not insure their homes, let alone have earthquake insurance. This needs to change, said Curcio, who thinks Italians need to be willing to have their homes assessed by insurers from a seismic point of view. But it will be difficult for politicians to engineer such a change and to persuade already straitened households, especially in deeply depressed and neglected rural areas where unemployment is sky high and economic prospects remain grim, to accept the cost of private insurance.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" In India, Biometric Data Storage Sparks Demands for Privacy Laws In India, calls for strict privacy laws are growing after this week's passage of a measure that allows federal agencies access to biometric data of the nation's citizens, the world's largest such repository. The government says the use of biometrics will help cut rampant graft in the distribution of subsidies, but activists and opposition lawmakers warn it could usher in an era of increased state surveillance. The Aadhaar card is being used to give welfare benefits to the poor, who often cannot provide any proof identity, allowing corrupt officials to siphon entitlements. The government says it has saved nearly $2 billion by preventing misuse of the subsidies in the last fiscal year alone. They point to identity-verification systems in other countries, where cards or identification numbers are used for verification without creating a gigantic central database that documents every last transaction. Indeed, the Aadhaar database also stores fingerprints and iris scans of every account holder, labeling each with a 12-digit identification number. (A. Pasricha/VOA) Some lawyers and privacy advocates say this has made it even more important to support a strong privacy law to ensure the huge government database isn't misused. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has defended the biometrics legislation, saying the data will be accessed only in rare cases that require authorization by a senior official. Prior to the intruduction of biometric cards, millions of poor people across India did not have any proof of identity, making it difficult for them to take advantage of government welfare programs. (A. Pasricha/VOA) Fraud concerns Despite objections, the bill was passed by legislators who argued that such a move is critical to ensuring subsidies reach intended beneficiaries in a country where millions are poor and illiterate. Attempts to draft a right to privacy bill to protect individuals against misuse of data by government or private agencies date back to 2010, but have made little headway. The latest push started in 2014. Nearly one billion biometric identity cards have been issued in India in the last six years.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Deforestation Rising in Amazon as Lack of Funds Hampers Guardians The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. An agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gunpoint. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. He walked away rather than watch it burn. When able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. But this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para. Trucks loaded with tree trunks are burned by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil, Nov. 11, 2016. Hampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) and pickup trucks easily recognized by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. Role in climate change Nearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. Ibama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. An aerial view of cleared land is seen during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging conducted by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, supported by military police, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil, Nov. 11, 2016. Over the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades. Last year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. Leaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. Here, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. A 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle because of a lack of fuel. It is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. Fallen trees are seen during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging conducted by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, supported by military police, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil, Nov. 11, 2016. Corruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month with taking bribes from logging companies. New strategy Brazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. The situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. But officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. Until four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. Ibama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. A mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. A Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources agent measures a tree trunk during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil, Nov. 11, 2016. Now, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. A carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. One option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalized. Pioneers Persuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. It lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north to south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. Environmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. Novo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. Then, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. Jose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. The impact of those pioneers is staggering. Now, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. With that has come increased power in Congress, and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. The transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane-polluting cattle. No jobs Ibama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. Burning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. But those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime, such as money laundering or violence.

Many in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. With no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labor, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. Pereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber.\",\n",

He said he planned to travel to Dallas in the coming days at the invitation of Mayor Mike Rawlings. The city remained on edge Saturday, especially after Dallas police received an anonymous threat against officers across the city.

He said if people care about the safety of police officers, they cannot pretend that the gun issue is irrelevant. He said it would never be possible to stop every violent madman intent on carnage, but the U.S. could make it much harder for them. He said the scope of gun violence in the United States is unique. U.S. Army retired Combat Medic Chandler Davis stood in quiet salute for hours at a makeshift memorial outside the Dallas Police Headquarters, in Dallas, Texas, July 9, 2016. On Saturday, the people of Dallas were working through the emotions of Thursday's violence and trying to make sense of the tragedy, which in addition to the fatalities it caused left seven officers and two civilians injured.

He said the country has made tremendous progress, both in lowering violent crime rates and on achieving racial equality. But, the president added, the legacy of racism endures, and there is much work still to be done. Obama said that he hoped his daughters, Sasha and Malia, and their children could live in a more just and equal country, but that progress takes time. The president left Warsaw after the news conference for Spain, arriving Saturday night.

From aboard Air Force One on the flight to Madrid, Obama phoned Texas Governor Greg Abbott to offer his condolences on behalf of the American people, a White House statement said. Details of attack Dallas Mayor Rawlings confirmed that the shooting of the officers on Thursday was carried out by a lone gunman, identified as Micah Johnson. Jasmine Ruiz writes a note at a makeshift memorial in front of the police department in Dallas, July 9, 2016. Five police officers were killed in a shooting in downtown Dallas on Thursday. Texas Governor Abbott said law enforcement officers would investigate and determine whether any co-conspirators or other suspects might have helped him. During a search of Johnson's home Friday, Dallas police detectives found bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics, the police department said. The gunman was a former Army reservist who served in Afghanistan. The attack was the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, on the U.S. East Coast.\",\n",

Since then, U.S. voting rolls have added millions of African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and others. Many states have broadened access to balloting, from improving ease of registration to expanding polling times and absentee voting. Under siege But some observers, particularly Democrats, see a Voting Rights Act under siege.

Attention to those changes heightened in June 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down a key VRA enforcement provision that required nine states with histories of flagrant racial discrimination to get federal approval before changing election procedures. Leo Smith, the Georgia GOP's director of minority engagement, applauds the decision for ending what he considers to be unfair, unevenly applied oversight. North Carolina in spotlight House Bill 589 ended same-day voter registration, stopped preregistering 16- and 17-year-olds, and cut back early voting from 17 days to 10. The U.S. Justice Department and several civil rights groups challenged the new election law, with their respective lawsuits combined in a federal case heard in July in the former tobacco town of Winston-Salem. They said the Republican-sponsored legislation meant to deliberately disenfranchise many black, Hispanic and young voters, who tend to vote for Democrats. But witnesses for the state testified that there was no discriminatory intent and that the voter turnout rate of African-Americans actually had increased in the 2014 midterms, after the new rules were in place, over 2010. U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder is expected to issue his decision later this year. Responding to Democratic critiques, the head of the Republican National Committee has said his party is embracing, not disenfranchising, minority voters. Uncomfortable reminders In the flurry of voting restrictions, some see echoes of a grim history. Two years later, the 15th Amendment granted that right. (Library of Congress) The 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, granted African-American men the right to vote. But some states and counties devised impediments. Barriers were highest in the segregated South, with its history of slavery. Blacks risked beating, whipping, lynching and other deadly force for daring to approach the polls. Vivian told VOA on a hot June afternoon at his home in Atlanta, Georgia. A Baptist minister, he'd helped launch a Nashville affiliate of the Southern Christian Leadership Council in 1955 and was among the demonstrators in the civil rights movement's first march, in 1960 in the Tennessee city. He was working on the executive staff of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), at the behest of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., when in early 1965 he went to register voters in Selma, Alabama. Until then, only 2 percent of the city's eligible blacks had been able to sign up. C.T. (J. Swicord/VOA) Vivian recalled confronting Sheriff Jim Clark, who proudly enforced local laws deterring Negros from registering and voting. Clark, solidly built and armed with a nightstick, blocked Vivian on the Dallas County courthouse steps, the activist recalled. So he decided to do what he always does and beat people.... He really, really hit me right across the face. The blow was so hard that the sheriff broke his own finger, he later said, contending Vivian provoked the beating by grabbing his nightstick. Vivian sprang back up to show fellow protesters they shouldn't be intimidated for demanding their constitutional right, he said. FILE - Alabama state troopers use clubs against voting rights marchers, including John Lewis, shown in foreground, in Selma on March 7, 1965. A signal event The civil rights movement reached a turning point March 7, 1965, a day that came to be known as Bloody Sunday. But as they left Selma, the marchers encountered 150 state troopers and deputies at the Edmund Pettis Bridge. I had a concussion at the bridge. Images of the attack, broadcast on television and splashed on news pages, horrified the nation. Two days after the violence, before a second attempted march, King stopped at the hospital to encourage the injured Lewis. King's prediction came true: He and 2,000 others completed the march to Montgomery on a third try late that month. And the act became law roughly five months later. Bills proposed One shows him at the White House with Johnson, hours before the president signed the 1965 law at the U.S. Capitol. Congressman John Lewis joins several dozen other Democrats at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge restoring a shelved Voting Rights Act protection, July 30, 2015. The next morning, he joined roughly 40 other Democratic lawmakers in front of the Capitol, where several took turns speaking at a podium adorned with a placard for a #RestoreTheVRA Twitter handle. They urged House Republicans to bring to a floor discussion two measures focused on fortifying the Voting Rights Act, and they promised to campaign this summer to bring them to voters' attention. Lewis is a co-sponsor of both. One is the bipartisan Voting Rights Amendment Act, proposed in 2013 and reintroduced this year by House members John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat who's the only sitting member of Congress to vote for the original law, and James Sensenbrenner, a conservative Wisconsin Republican who has been a key supporter for renewing the Voting Rights Act since the 1980s. The other bill is the Voting Rights Advancement Act, whose lead sponsors are two Democrats. One is Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, whose district is near Shelby County, the named plaintiff in the Supreme Court case. The new measures offer updated criteria on the preclearance formula determining which states or jurisdictions should be subject to prior federal approval for election changes. Instead of looking at violations over a 40-year period, the proposed legislation would look at more recent infractions: over the last 15 years for the Amendment Act and 25 for the Advancement Act. With that and other criteria, four states immediately would qualify for preclearance under the Amendment Act; 13 would do so under the Advancement Act. Just after the high court's ruling two years ago, Sensenbrenner joined Lewis in testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House Judiciary Committee's chairman, Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, has said it's not necessary to restore federal oversight of once-troubled jurisdictions. His state is one of the nine that had required preclearance. But, according to USA Today, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said he would welcome committee debate on the preclearance provision. Sewell said she and others owe a debt to all who worked toward passage and reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act over the years.\",\n",

Immigration issue Rubio campaigned for the Senate in 2010 on a tough immigration stance, saying he would never support blanket amnesty. The bill passed in the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives. In a testy exchange with Kelly, Rubio denied he had changed his position on immigration, easily one of the most contentious issues for the Republicans. Chris Christie makes a point as Rand Paul listens during a Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 28, 2016. Bush attacked Rubio, saying the senator had sought his support as governor on legislation that would allow a pathway to citizenship. Attacks on Cruz Cruz also had to answer video clips that showed him saying he would support immigration reform legislation, if some of the amendments he had offered were approved. He denied he had changed his stance, saying his amendments were not to fix all of the legislation's problems but to ensure undocumented immigrants in the U.S. couldn't gain legal status. Cruz's reply brought attacks from both Paul and Rubio. Fox, which partnered with Google for Thursday's debate, used questions from various Americans throughout the debate. One such question came from Dulce Candy, an Iraq war veteran who was brought to this country from Mexico as a child. Audience members listen to the Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 28, 2016. Appearing via YouTube, Candy asked how immigrants should feel welcome in the United States, given the harsh rhetoric regarding immigrants and refugees by the party's candidates during the past few months.

But Thursday's spotlight was stolen by the Republicans' leading contender, billionaire real estate mogul Trump. He refused to take part in the debate because of what he alleged was poor treatment by Fox News. Fox said the flamboyant Trump, a political novice who has surged to the top of political surveys of Republican voters, was welcome at the debate and would be treated fairly. But the network refused to replace moderator Kelly, who angered Trump at an August debate by asking him about slurs he has made over the years about women. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true thisSnippet = (d.getElementsByClassName ? eval.innerHTML = userInput; return; var tag = elm.tagName.toLowerCase(); return; js.id = sId; firstJs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, firstJs); thisSnippet.appendChild(bquote); window.twttr.widgets.load(); //fix twitter bug rendering multiple embeds per tweet.

       " {'content': \" US Presidential Candidates Trade Barbs Over Terrorism The leading U.S. presidential candidates are trading new ideas and sharp barbs over how best to cope with the threat of terrorism in the immediate aftermath of the deadly Brussels terrorist attacks. The Republican front-runner, billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, suggested that Tuesday's attack in the Belgian capital that killed at least 31 people and injured another 271 could have been prevented if authorities had resorted to harsh interrogation techniques, including torture, against Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam, who was captured in Belgium last week.

Clinton attacks Trump Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives to a cheering crowd to speak at a campaign event at the Grady Cole Center in Charlotte, N.C., Monday, March 14, 2016. The charged atmosphere about possible terrorist threats in the United States came as voters cast ballots Tuesday in three more presidential nominating contests, in the western states of Arizona, Utah and Idaho. Tuesday's results Trump routed Cruz in Arizona, along the U.S.-Mexican border, winning all 58 of the state's delegates to the Republican national nominating convention in July. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks to the media about events in Brussels near the Capitol in Washington, March 22, 2016. Cruz easily won in heavily Mormon Utah, collecting all 40 of the state's national convention delegates. The day's results left Trump far ahead in the race to win enough pledged convention delegates ahead of the quadrennial gathering, but still 40 percent away from the majority of delegates he needs to claim the nomination. Cruz on Wednesday picked up the endorsement of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race last month. In a statement released by the Cruz campaign, Bush called Cruz the only hope for Republicans to win back the White House and criticized Trump. FILE - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush stands in front of a photo of former president and brother George W. Bush as he speaks at the New Hampshire GOP's FITN Presidential town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire, Jan. 23, 2016. The next Republican voting is set for April 5, with a party primary in the Midwestern state of Wisconsin. A third contender in the Republican contest, Ohio Governor John Kasich, was not a factor in either Arizona or Utah. Kasich's last hope Kasich cannot mathematically win the nomination before the national convention and is banking his hopes on winning it then if neither Trump nor Cruz has claimed it ahead of time. A new Quinnipiac University poll Wednesday showed that Kasich is the only Republican, and not Trump or Cruz, who would defeat Clinton in a hypothetical match in the November national election. The winner of the U.S. election will replace President Barack Obama, who leaves office in January 2017. Clinton easily won Tuesday's Democratic primary in Arizona against her sole rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, but he captured two party caucuses against her, in Utah and Idaho. Sanders, who has centered his campaign on the growing income equality in the United States and the power of Wall Street financial titans, won a handful more convention delegates than Clinton in the three contests, but remains far behind her in the overall race to win the Democratic nomination.\",\n",

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally declared victory on Monday in the city that the militant group had declared the capital of its caliphate in Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi (C) holds an Iraqi flag as he announces victory over Islamic State in Mosul, July 10, 2017. Speaking from Mosul's Old City in a speech carried on state television, Abadi said the win is a victory over oppression, brutality and terrorism. Abadi said Iraq still faces challenges, including destroying Islamic State terror cells that still exist in the country and creating stability for the entire nation. The U.S. military welcomed Abadi's statement but said there are still areas of the Old City of Mosul that must be cleared of explosives and possible ISIS fighters in hiding. Hours before Abadi's speech, witnesses reported heavy fighting still underway in parts of Mosul. Islamic State still controls some territory outside Mosul as well as much bigger areas in neighboring Syria. Will it ever feel safe again? Thousands of civilians have been killed in this battle and 900,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Vast swaths of Mosul and the surrounding towns and villages have been abandoned, and many people say they will never feel safe going home.

Murdock/VOA) And while no part of Mosul is as thoroughly destroyed as the Old City, neither has any part been left untouched by nearly three years of Islamic State rule and almost nine months of all-out war. Human rights group Amnesty International released a report Tuesday detailing the loss of civilian life in the battle for Mosul, documenting at least 400 civilian deaths just in West Mosul between January and mid-May. About 900,000 people have been displaced by the battle for Mosul and many neighborhoods like Mosul's Old City have been completely destroyed by the war, July 9, 2017. (H. Murdock/VOA) In parts of East Mosul, recaptured by Iraqi forces in January, recovery is more promising. Shoppers crowd the streets, some of which are newly paved, mostly picking through wreckage left by airstrikes. The government has restored electricity and water supplies in much of the city. At an Iraqi base in Mosul, suspected IS militants are held before being transported to authorities, July 9, 2017. (H. Murdock/VOA) Washington Institute for Near East Policy Distinguished Fellow and former Ambassador James Jeffrey told VOA that relief and recovery efforts are only the first step after the recapture of Mosul.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Attacks Against US Muslims Growing in Frequency, Violence The cold-blooded killing of a New York imam and his assistant over the weekend has heightened Muslim American fears of rising violence against the 3.5 million-strong community. While prosecutors have yet to uncover any religious motive in the shootings of Imam Maulama Akonjee and Thara Uddin, to many Muslims, the murders illustrate the increasingly violent face of Islamophobia in the United States. A surge in Islamophobia seen in recent years has been driven to a large extent by anti-Muslim political rhetoric and violent extremism, among other factors, Abdelkader said. The figures are based on published news reports and incidents reported by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Washington-based Muslim advocacy organization. On average, the study recorded 18 incidents per month during the 12-month period, including 12 murders, 34 physical assaults, 49 verbal assaults or threats against individuals and institutions, 56 acts of vandalism or destruction of property, nine arsons, and eight shootings and bombings. The actual number may be higher, as many incidents go unreported, Abdelkader said. Steady uptick FILE - Students chant while marching at a rally against Islamophobia at San Diego State University in San Diego, California, Nov. 23, 2015. Between January and July, the tracker has recorded 87 acts of aggression, a broad category that includes threats, physical assaults and vandalism of mosques. Among incidents recorded in the past two months: • On June 29, a man approached a group of Muslim men wearing Islamic attire in Minneapolis, Minnesota, made anti-Islamic remarks before opening fire on them, wounding two of them. Inspired by terrorist attacks The sharp increase in anti-Muslim attacks has come during a period of public anxiety over several high profile terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S. Indeed, three spikes in anti-Muslim violence recorded over the past year followed the Paris and San Bernardino attacks last year and the Orlando shooting in June. In November, Georgetown recorded 35 acts or threats of violence against Muslims in America, up from eight the previous month, after terrorists killed 130 people in a series of coordinated attacks in Paris. In December, it documented a record 53 incidents, after a Muslim couple inspired by the Islamic State killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. And in June, 2016, the month that saw the largest domestic terror attack since the 9/11 attacks, the Huffington Post documented 24 acts of aggression, the highest monthly figure since it started tracking Islamophobia in January.

       " {'content': \" Germany, Italy Push for EU Mission on Libya-Niger Border to Deter Migrants The interior ministers of Germany and Italy are urging the European Union to set up a mission along Libya's border with Niger in a bid to stop mainly African migrants from reaching Europe. In a letter to the European Commission, the ministers say that international efforts so far to curb the migrant flow have proven insufficient. According to the United Nations, more than 43,000 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, have reached European shores this year from Libya and a surge in migrant crossings is expected this spring and summer. FILE - Sub-Saharan migrants are rescued by members of Proactiva Open Arms NGO at the Mediterranean sea, about 20 miles north of Ra's Tajura, Libya, Jan. 12, 2017. Nearly 1,200 migrants have died at sea trying to cross the Mediterranean. They also want for the EU to help support economic growth and development in communities along the border. FILE - Illegal migrants arrive by boat at a naval base after they were rescued by Libyan coastguard in the coastal city of Tripoli, Libya, May 10, 2017. Italy has borne the brunt of the migration crisis since Europe concluded a deal with Turkey to stem the movement of migrants and war refugees into EU countries. European leaders are worried about a possible rush of newcomers, increasing the pressure on southern European states, such as Italy and Malta, but also roiling further politics on the continent and fueling anti-immigrant and far-right sentiment. A scheme to relocate asylum-seekers continues to face stiff opposition from central European countries, especially Hungary and Slovakia. FILE - Migrants sit on their belongings in the back of a truck as it is driven through a dusty road in the desert town of Agadez, Niger, headed for Libya, May 25, 2015. How enthusiastic EU member states will be to the request to set up a mission along the Libya-Niger border will partly be colored by the reaction of European military officials, say analysts. The memo counseling caution was leaked to WikiLeaks. FILE - A boy walks past a signboard for the International Migration Organization's transit center in Agadez, Niger, May 11, 2016. The International Organization for Migration estimated that more than a quarter-of-a-million migrants crossed the Libya-Niger border last year. The EU already has five migrant centers located in Niger, part of an effort to vet asylum-seekers and discourage migrants from risking the crossing into Libya and the Mediterranean and putting their lives into the hands of traffickers. One of the three governments vying for control of Libya, the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord, has said it is willing to cooperate with the Europeans, but it has no reliable forces of its own and relies on the volatile backing of some militias whose loyalty could shift unpredictably. He said the move was designed to ease the burden on police and security agencies for the two-day summit, which begins May 26.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Zimbabwe Court Takes Up Mugabe Re-election Challenge Mugabe's swearing in has been put on hold and investors have been cautious since the re-election of the 89-year-old leader because of his policy of seizing foreign owned firms. Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change accuse the Zimbabwe Election Commission of rigging the election for Mugabe's Zanu PF party. On Wednesday, they were at the Electoral Court to force the commission to produce all election materials. Lewis Uriri, the lawyer for Tsvangirai, told reporters that the court reserved judgment. There must be a reason why they do not want to produce those materials. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai speaks at the burial of an activist in Harare, Aug. 14, 2013. The election commission declared that Mugabe defeated Tsvangirai, 61 to 34 percent in the July 31 polls, which Tsvangirai is challenging. There is need for Mugabe to see to it that his indigenization policy does not appear as a vendetta or a slogan.

The panel discussed the Islamic State group's adept use of social media and propaganda to recruit members worldwide in a joint forum, called ISIS and the Digital War, conducted by the Voice of America and the Newseum. The Islamic State group differs from its predecessor, al-Qaida, in delivering its message, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Program on Extremism at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. ...

And they are quite effective, Maruf said. Anti-IS campaign Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the Newseum Institute, said young people tend to get their news from other people their age or their friends. Un-Islamic However, the Baroness Emma Nicholson of Winterbourne, president and chairwoman of the AMAR International Charitable Foundation, said the message is completely un-Islamic. Vidino said the recruitment materials appeal to a certain segment. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true thisSnippet = (d.getElementsByClassName ? eval.innerHTML = userInput; return; var tag = elm.tagName.toLowerCase(); return; js.id = sId; firstJs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, firstJs); thisSnippet.appendChild(bquote); window.twttr.widgets.load(); //fix twitter bug rendering multiple embeds per tweet.

Maruf said families should watch for warning signs, such as changes in behavior or complaints about the West. She mentioned a program her charity has developed in southern Iraq that fosters religious tolerance that has been successful. Vidino, of George Washington University's extremism center, said society has a major role to play in combatting the radical Islamic State message. Weiss, who has reported on the group for several years, suggested a two-pronged approach: stem the flow of foreign fighters and engage the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Syria President Bashar Assad arrive for their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Oct. 20, 2015.. Moderate Muslims When asked if moderate Muslims needed to take a more active role in countering the Islamic State message on Islam, Nicholson and Weiss bristled. In it, he explains how the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), evolved from a nearly defeated Iraqi insurgent group into a jihadi army of international volunteers who have conquered territory equal to the size of Great Britain. Operation Inherent Resolve, as the U.S.-led coalition's military operation is called, began airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq in June 2014. The air campaign was expanded in September 2014 to battle the militant group in Syria.

Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding areas, has been under assault by extremists As of September 15, the total cost of operations related to the anti-Islamic State fight was about $4 billion, with the average daily cost of about $10 million, according to Department of Defense records. Nearly 60 countries are involved in various aspects of the anti-Islamic State campaign, with about 10 countries joining the U.S. in airstrikes.

John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading critic of Obama's policy in Syria, has previously urged the president to establish a no-fly zone in Syria to protect Syrians from the Assad regime's barrel bombing. In early October, the U.S. announced it was abandoning efforts to build up a new rebel force inside Syria to combat the Islamic State group. A $500 million campaign that was supposed to train several thousand fighters was deemed a failure after training just 60 men. The administration said money would instead be used to provide ammunition and weapons for some U.S.-backed rebel groups already in the region. Just days after the announcement to curtail the program, the U.S. airdropped 50 tons of small-arms ammunition to rebels in northern Syria, a U.S. defense official said.

       " {'content': \" Role of Terrorism in Shooting Causes Multiple Concerns, Fears Links between the Islamic State group and Tashfeen Malik, which the Pakistani native confirmed just before she and her husband opened fire with automatic rifles and slaughtered 14 people in California on Wednesday, have greatly expanded concerns about foreign terrorists' influence on American soil. Malik, 29, and her American-born husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, are now the principal focus of an enormous effort by U.S. authorities to discover what motivated or inspired the couple to plan and carry out the attacks, which primarily targeted Farook's co-workers in California's San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles. Malik and Farook fled the bloodbath and were at large for several hours Wednesday, until they tried to shoot their way out of a police cordon and died in a volley of hundreds of bullets. Before that bloody ending, however, a message apparently posted by Malik appeared on Facebook in which she pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group, and specifically to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in Syria. FILE - A police officer picks up a weapon from the scene of the investigation around the area of the SUV vehicle where two suspects were shot by police following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Dec. 3, 2015. Terror claims Bowdich and other law-enforcement officials in California have steered clear of specifically tying Malik and Farook's actions to Islamic extremism. But many investigators and experts who study extremist groups suspect Islamic State's claims about the California couple may be borne out. FILE - Federal Bureau of Investigation assistant director David Bowdich speaks during a news conference in San Bernardino, Calif., Dec. 4, 2015. The San Bernardino shootings could be seen as the worst assault on the United States by Islamic extremists since the multiple attacks on New York and Washington by al-Qaida-sponsored terrorists on September 11, 2001. Hijacked commercial airliners crashed at each location. Since the Islamic State group became a fierce and notoriously brutal force in recent years in Iraq and Syria, it has called repeatedly on its followers to stage violent attacks against the United States as well as U.S. coalition partners in Europe and the Gulf. An undated combination of California Department of Motor Vehicles photos shows Tashfeen Malik, left, and Syed Farook, the husband and wife who died in a gunbattle with authorities after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., Dec. 2, 2015. A claim lends credibility to the call to battle, Thomas Sanderson explained. The new study on terrorist infiltration found up to 300 Americans or U.S.-based people sympathetic to the Islamic State group who are active on social media. A third of them are women. FILE - Women and children attend the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA members prayer vigil for the victims of Wednesday's massacre at the San Bernardino's Baitul Hameed Mosque in Chino, Calif., Dec. 3, 2015. It is not clear whether whether Malik or Farook first became radicalized, or when and where. They reportedly met first online. Malik was living in Saudi Arabia; Farook visited there and Pakistan last year, returning with Malik, who was granted a U.S. visa as his fiancée. Neither was on a watch list, according to authorities. The couple married in the United States and had a baby daughter about six months ago.

To get a U.S. fiancée visa, or K-1 nonimmigrant visa, requires rigorous screening, says Palma Yanni, a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Applicants face a battery of security hurdles, including repeated biometric and biographic testing, international checks for financial and criminal records, and interviews at a U.S. consulate, Yanni said. Yanni pointed out applicants must marry within 90 days of entering the United States and must file another set of papers to confirm they married. she wondered.\",\n",

On the Senate side of the Capitol Tuesday, the Republican majority leader said he would oppose measures proposed by Democrats but seemed to leave the door open to some change. Back on the House side, during a sometimes rowdy session late Monday, other members fled the floor to avoid discussion of three pieces of legislation that House Democrats say would help prevent future attacks, including strengthening background checks and preventing individuals on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns.

Seeking a vote Clyburn, who knew some of the victims of last year's Charleston church shooting personally, told reporters immediately after he wanted to ask the Republican leadership if gun control legislation could be brought up for a vote. His effort reflected an increasing reluctance on the part of House Democrats to treat the death of 49 people in an Orlando nightclub as yet another addition to the list of mass shootings in the United States. Law enforcement officials in front of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, June 15, 2016. (Photo: S. Dizayee / VOA ) House Democrat Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told reporters in a briefing Tuesday morning that moments of silence should be followed by action. He acknowledged the possibility that House Democrats could bring gun control legislation up for a vote by adding amendments to spending bills, but he said it had not yet been decided. Their passage is endangered by the addition of amendments and counter-amendments involving rights for LGBT federal contractors. The fight prompted House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to move away from an open-rule process that allows members to introduce amendments that can endanger bills. FILE - Rep. Peter King (R- NY) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill. Rep. Peter King, a Republican from New York, told VOA on Monday he did not think his bill preventing individuals on the terror watch list from purchasing guns could be revived, even in the wake of the Orlando shooting. I put the bill in. I support it. Divisions over gun control only continued Tuesday as House members received a classified security briefing from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. People leave flowers and other items at a makeshift vigil outside the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is close to where the mass shooting occurred at the Pulse gay nightclub early Sunday in Orlando, Florida, June 14, 2016. Senate side The Orlando attack prompted Senate Republicans to demand a stepped-up campaign to defeat the Islamic State group, the group to which shooter Omar Mateen pledged allegiance during his rampage at the Pulse nightclub. Democrats, meanwhile, are joining forces with their House colleagues to revive long-stalled legislation restricting gun sales and introduce new ones. In addition, Democrat Bob Casey of Pennsylvania wants to bar those convicted of hate crimes from buying a gun. FILE -- Three variations of the AR-15 assault rifle are displayed in Sacramento, Calif. Assault weapons Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who spent much of Sunday in Orlando after the attack, is among many Democrats who want to go a step further and reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons.

While the event was predominately peaceful, some students were detained late in the day after throwing bricks and bottles at police who were blocking their way with riot vehicles and shooting rubber bullets in the air, according to an observer on the scene at the time of the clash. Police were preventing the marchers from entering Tahrir Square, the epicenter of mass protests in 2011 and 2013. Sunday, despite the arrest of several education officials earlier this month in connection with the scandal, questions and answers to a national exam appeared online, accessible to some students via mobile phone.

The year-end exams, they said, are crucial because they often determine college admittance and which majors they are allowed to pursue within the university system.

       " {'content': \" US Voting Restrictions Fuel Tensions Among the political and legal fights over U.S. elections, some of the most contentious ones center on voter identification requirements and on the way political districts are drawn. Historically, both sometimes have been misused to suppress minority voting, which the Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to correct. Voter ID As of this spring, 32 states had voter identification laws in place; North Carolina will join them in 2016, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports. Most of the new measures have been introduced and implemented by Republican-led legislatures. While some states permit the use of bank statements, student IDs or other evidence of state residence, stricter ones require approved photo IDs, such as government-issued driver's licenses and passports. Supporters say voter ID requirements battle fraud and build confidence in election fairness. Critics say that voter impersonation is rare and that the laws disproportionately discourage the poor, minorities, senior citizens and students from voting. Someone born in the 1920s or '30s in a rural part of the country might not have a formal birth certificate, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Georgia. Melvin Robertson lacks an appropriate voter ID under a recently enacted Wisconsin law. Melvin Robertson understands that predicament. A resident of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he has voted for most of his 86 years. But he may not be able to cast a ballot in the next election. Strict rule in Wisconsin Wisconsin has just enacted a controversial voter ID law. It was passed in 2011, pushed through the GOP-led legislature and signed by Republican Governor Scott Walker. It was halted by a series of legal challenges and even frozen by the U.S. Supreme Court last fall. But when the high court declined to hear the case, the law took effect after a statewide election in April. Now, Robertson and an estimated 340,000 other state residents lack the proper documentation to vote. Robertson has a Social Security card and a city-issued ID. But when he tried to get a copy of his birth certificate at the Milwaukee County courthouse, there was no such record on file. FILE - Under Governor Scott Walker, Wisconsin has implemented a strict voter ID law. When Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed the law, he cited concern for voter fraud and support for election integrity as the motivations. Incidence of voter fraud Opponents cried voter suppression, saying there is almost no evidence of voter fraud in the state. Walker, now a Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election, has vowed Wisconsin will make every effort to ensure that legitimate voters have necessary identification, even if it means offering IDs at no cost to individuals. Anita Johnson, who works with the Democracy 2020 coalition in Wisconsin, discusses voting law changes at a Milwaukee street festival in June. (J. Swicord/VOA) Anita Johnson is a Milwaukee community activist trying to help residents understand the recent changes in voting law. Question intent? Republican Milwaukee County Election Commissioner Rick Baas takes issue with the idea that the law is unfair to minorities. Andra Gillespie, an Emory University political scientist, encourages looking at the impact of voter ID laws on registration. (J. Swicord/VOA) But a U.S. congresswoman from the neighboring state of Alabama believes it's a deterrent. Representative Terri Sewell said when Alabama implemented its voter ID law in 2014, she learned firsthand how challenging it could be. Sewell, who worries such obstacles would discourage other voters, is sponsoring legislation to restore related Voting Rights Act provisions set aside by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013.

The Constitution requires states to adjust voting districts and boundaries every 10 years, reflecting population shifts found in Census data. (An interactive game shows the challenges.) In many states, district boundaries are drawn by lawmakers seeking a partisan advantage. Some of the strangest-looking congressional districts are in Texas, where a legal fight continues over boundaries drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2010. The courts are trying to determine if the redistricting maps violated provisions of the Voting Rights Act. One-party rule Redistricting has contorted Texas' 35th Congressional District. Democrats are responsible for the upside-down elephant shape of the 35th District, which connects parts of Austin, the capital, with San Antonio some 129 kilometers or 80 miles to the south. In the early 1990s, they tried to corral as many liberal voters as possible into the district. Republican Larry Gonzales, who serves in the Texas House of Representatives, defends the redistricting effort led by his party. (J. Swicord/VOA). Larry Gonzales, a Republican in the Texas House of Representatives, represents a community where the redistricting plans that he helped design are being challenged.

Renteria has a boyhood memory of the 1960 presidential election in Texas, where his father and other Latinos faced discriminatory voting practices. Five decades later, the political landscape has changed. Instead, voters deserve to have political jurisdictions determined by nonpartisan citizen committees, Renteria said. Independent commissions already are used by seven states: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey and Washington. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed their right to have them.

The Chinese president said he hopes all sides avoid doing anything to worsen the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, according to the Xinhua news agency.

North Korea threats The conversations involving the president about North Korea took place as a U.S. Navy strike force, led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, is approaching the Sea of Japan, off the east coast of the Korean peninsula. Aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) transits the Indian Ocean, April 15, 2017. Jeff Davis told reporters at the Pentagon. Officials in Seoul announced earlier Monday the Vinson is also scheduled to hold a joint training exercise with South Korean naval ships. He provided no additional details. The approach of the American naval carrier strike group has not gone unnoticed in Pyongyang. Such threats are common from the reclusive state. North Korea on Tuesday celebrates the anniversary of the founding of its military, a key holiday in the country. There are concerns Pyongyang, in conjunction with the anniversary, will demonstrate a show of force by possibly firing more ballistic missiles or conducting its sixth nuclear test. Trump has said that Xi is applying pressure on North Korea to not engage in further provocations. It is speculated by analysts in Washington and Beijing that China is threatening to cut crude oil supplies to its impoverished neighbor should it conduct another nuclear test. U.S. citizen detained Meanwhile, a third U.S. citizen was detained Friday by North Korean authorities as he was about to leave the country. Toner at the State Department told reporters he was not aware of any diplomatic access to the American.

The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) confirmed the detention of Kim Sang-duk, who had been teaching accounting at the privately-funded school started by evangelical Christians. At least two other U.S. citizens are known to be held in North Korea. The U.S. State Department said it is working with Swedish diplomats on the case. The United States and North Korea have never had diplomatic ties. Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang represents the interests of American citizens in the country. North Korea has a pattern of detaining and sentencing American visitors to prison in order to get high-profile visitors to go there to obtain their release.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Analysts: Iran-Saudi Crisis Compounds Regional Wars As countries and militias line up behind regional giants Iran and Saudi Arabia, analysts say the diplomatic crisis is already having an impact across the region. FILE - A Shi'ite protester carries a poster of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr during a demonstration outside the Saudi embassy in Sanaa, Oct. 18, 2014. Islamic State militants have the most to gain from the crisis, which is spreading the chaos the group thrives on and dividing the region, he adds. Kuwait is the latest Sunni-dominated country to withdraw its ambassador from Iran, following Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, which have all either cut ties or downgraded their relationships with Iran following an international dispute over the execution of Shi'ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. After the execution, the Saudi embassy in Tehran was attacked and Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties. Smoke rises as Iranian protesters set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran, Sunday, Jan. 3, 2016. Protesters upset over the execution of a Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia set fires to the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Roots of dispute The regional rift is far deeper than the current dispute, according to Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the United States. Iranian demonstrators hold anti-Saudi placards in a rally to protest the execution by Saudi Arabia last week of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a prominent opposition Saudi Shiite cleric, in Tehran, Iran, Jan. 4, 2016. If the nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers is implemented, Tehran is expected to be relieved of sanctions, greatly expanding its economic power and ability to fund militias in the region, like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. But it is not just an economic rivalry, says Fitzpatrick. Additionally, both countries are using the dispute as a power play in domestic politics, says Max Abrahms, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and political science professor at Northeastern University. Long-term impact An outright war between the powers may be unlikely, adds Cafiero, but both Saudi Arabia and Iran may increase their involvement in Syria and Yemen, often seen as a fight between two regional giants.

Rescue workers at the wreckage of an airplane that was carrying the Brazilian soccer club Chapecoense when it crashed outside Medellin, Colombia, Nov. 29, 2016. Rescue efforts were hindered by difficulty reaching the mountainous crash site and low visibility. Alfredo Bocanegra, head of Columbia's civil aviation agency, said authorities could not rule out the possibility that the plane ran out of fuel before it crashed, but the main focus of the investigation was on a possible electrical failure. Leandro Bastos of Chapecoense's under-15 soccer team sits inside the team's locker room at the Arena Conda stadium in Chapeco, Brazil, Nov. 29, 2016.

The ruling will allow high school student Gavin Grimm to move forward with a lawsuit he filed last year. The rock group Boston also canceled three planned concerts in North Carolina with an announcement on their Facebook page Monday. Last week, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory responded to intense criticism over the state's legislation, signing an executive order that alters key provisions in the measure but leaves in place its most controversial elements. FILE - North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory at the governor's mansion in Raleigh, N.C., April 12, 2016. The executive order allows private businesses in the state to establish their own policies regarding the use of bathrooms and locker rooms by transgender people and restores some of the equal opportunity employment policies and rights to sue for discrimination. Controversial part of law The order signed last week does not change the most controversial part of the law, which stipulates that bathrooms and locker rooms in public schools, agencies and universities must be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex at birth. Transgender people would only be entitled to use bathroom facilities matching their preferred gender identity if they have had their birth certificates legally changed to reflect their transition from male to female or the reverse. McCrory signed the legislation into law last month. The move comes as the debate in the United States over differences between religious beliefs and individual rights shows no signs of flagging. Laws seen as undermining LGBT rights in several Southern states have sparked protests and boycott threats from businesses and entertainers, as well as counterdemonstrations by conservatives. FILE - Supporters of House Bill 2 gather outside the North Carolina State Capitol in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2016. Hundreds of people gathered last week in Raleigh, North Carolina, near the governor's offices, to support the bill. A smaller crowd of about 100 people staged a counterprotest. Opponents of N.C. law FILE - A police officer confronts a woman holding a sign at the North Carolina State Capitol in Raleigh, N.C., April 11, 2016. Many businesses have criticized the law, but few have taken specific action to underscore their disagreement with the state over the issue. The National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which had been considering moving sporting events out of the state as a protest, have since decided they will not change venues. The North Carolina NAACP has threatened civil disobedience if the state legislature does not act to repeal the law when it comes back into session April 25. Mark Creech of the Christian Action League told the crowd in Raleigh that his organization plans to rally in support of the law when the legislature reconvenes. Principles vs. religious beliefs The first gender-neutral restroom in the Los Angeles school district is seen at Santee Education Complex high school in Los Angeles, California, April 18, 2016. In Mississippi, protests greeted a law signed by Governor Phil Bryant allowing business owners in Mississippi to refuse service to same-sex couples. It also would allow employers to determine workplace policies based on their religious beliefs. A statement on singer Bryan Adams' Facebook page, canceling a concert in Mississippi after the state passed a law allowing business owners in the state to refuse service to same-sex couples. Ninety-five prominent writers, including winners of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize and a former national poet laureate, wrote in an open letter of protest that the law known as House Bill 1523 does not reflect Mississippi's compassionate nature. On the other side of the issue, Republican State Senator Richard Briggs, a physician from the city of Knoxville, defended the bill. Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam said he will review the final text of the bill before deciding whether to sign it into law. Earlier this month, the Tennessee Legislature also moved for a second time to designate the Bible the official state book. The bill is widely perceived as a violation of the separation between church and state as enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\",\n",

Reclaims land In the last two years China has reclaimed at least 1,170 hectares of land in the South China Sea, building upon small reefs, shoals and islets. This week came another reminder of their efforts to fortify their existing outposts: the U.S. said China appeared to have deployed HQ-9 surface-to-air missile batteries on Woody Island in the Paracel chain, drawing official protest from Vietnam and expressions of concern from U.S. naval brass. Speaking at the annual WEST Conference in San Diego on Thursday,U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Adm. Scott Swift said China has twice previously deployed HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island for missile defense exercises, including exercises to shoot down unmanned aircrafts. With the weapons and military infrastructure Beijing is stationing on the man-made islands being built in disputed waters, some more than 800 kilometers from the mainland, China is gaining both a quick strike capability and naval superiority over other countries in the region.

FBI directors are given ten year terms to shield themselves from political coercion. Trump's decision not to push for investigations into Clinton's email use or the Clinton Foundation may not deter some Republican Party members on Capitol Hill. Republican Congressman James Chaffetz, who chairs the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has promised to continue to investigate Clinton's use of emails. By backing off his promises to investigate Clinton, Trump's has outraged some of his most passionate supporters.

       " {'content': \" Trump, Clinton Try to Grab Attention of Undecided Voters in Key States Two days ahead of the U.S. presidential election, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton were campaigning Sunday in key election states, a last-minute bid by both candidates to grab the attention of undecided voters and find a path to victory. National surveys continue to show Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, with a narrow edge over Trump, a blunt-spoken real estate mogul making his first run for elected office. Most polling analysts are predicting a Clinton victory on Tuesday, but her advantage over Trump is not insurmountable. Collections of recent national polls show Clinton, looking to become the country's first female president, with about a two- or three-percentage-point edge over Trump. The latest major tracking poll by The Washington Post and ABC News pegged her lead at 48-43 percent. From left, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; actress Debra Messing; Sen. Bob Casey, Jr., D-Pa.; musician Katy Perry; Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton; candidate for U.S. Senate Katie McGinty; candidate for U.S House of Representative; Dwight Evans, Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa., and television producer Shonda Rhimes appear on stage during a Get Out the Vote concert at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. U.S. presidential elections, however, are not decided by the national popular vote but rather in the Electoral College, where the results are tallied in each of the 50 states and the national capital, Washington. The biggest states have the most electors in the Electoral College. Both Clinton and Trump need a majority of at least 270 of the 538 electors to win. Both Clinton and Trump have been heavily campaigning in numerous states where the outcome is most in doubt, especially two Atlantic coastal states, Florida and North Carolina. On Sunday, however, Trump was set for rallies in five other states and Clinton in three. Her surrogate, President Barack Obama, made another stop in Florida, a state with 29 electoral votes that Trump concedes he needs to capture to have a chance to claim the presidency. Obama has made 13 campaign appearances for Clinton, exhorting voters to uphold his presidential policies on numerous fronts, most of which Clinton has vowed to continue. Trump says he quickly plans to undermine them if he wins. President Barack Obama waves to supporters at Florida International University in Miami, Nov. 3, 2016, during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In fact, it is about building on the gains and progress we've made in the last eight years. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton attends Sunday services at Mt. Airy Church of God and Christ, Nov. 6, 2016, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Trump started his day in the farm state of Iowa, where he has held a small but consistent lead, and then headed to three states that have long voted for Democratic presidential contenders, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, in hopes of turning them away from Clinton. He was ending the day with a stop in Virginia, a state that once routinely voted for Republican White House aspirants but twice went for Obama, a Democrat, in 2008 and 2012. In Iowa, Trump predicted that Clinton would be indicted for her handling of classified material on her private, unsecured email server while she was the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton talks to supporters at Reed's Coffee and Tea House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Nov. 5, 2016. Aside from her stop in Pennsylvania, where she is ahead, Clinton is campaigning in states where Trump has forged a lead -- Ohio, a large Midwestern state with a mix of big cities and vast farmlands, and New Hampshire, a small northeastern state dotted with quaint towns. More than 41 million Americans have already voted in early voting allowed in many states. One hundred thirty million are expected to have voted by the end of Tuesday. Analysts say Clinton has several paths to reach the 270-electoral vote figure and become the country's 45th president when Obama leaves office in January. Trump's chances appear to be narrower; he needs to win battleground states he has been contesting with Clinton and capture some of the 18 states that have voted for Democratic presidential candidates in each of the last six elections. Polling shows the Trump-Clinton contests in Michigan and Pennsylvania especially could be close on Election Day, and both candidates are staging last-minute rallies there. Clinton, ahead in Michigan throughout the campaign, is making her first stop in the state Monday, while her husband, former President Bill Clinton, visited Sunday and Obama on Monday. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are joining both Clintons at an election eve rally Monday night in Philadelphia, the country's fifth largest city and a Democratic stronghold. Both Clinton and Trump have been painting a dark picture of what the country would look like with the other in the White House. Supporters of Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, cheer as he arrives to speak during a campaign rally, in Denver, Colorado, Nov. 5, 2016. Trump was referring to the email controversy that has dogged Clinton throughout her presidential run. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently announced the agency had discovered thousands of emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

       " {'content': \" Obama Speaks by Phone to Iran's Rouhani President Obama and Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, have spoken by telephone, discussing efforts to resolve long-running international concerns over Iran's nuclear program. It was the first such contact in more than 30 years. Obama revealed his phone call with President Rouhani at the beginning of a previously unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room. A senior administration official said the White House received word Friday morning that Rouhani wanted to talk with President Obama before the Iranian leader departed New York. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaks to journalists during a news conference in New York September 27, 2013. The administration official said the White House had also noticed President Rouhani's tweets to Obama, which expressed gratitude for his hospitality and the phone call. Even with the history of mistrust between the U.S. and Iran, Obama said, steps taken so far could offer hope for resolving the dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Iran has always denied that the program is aimed at developing a nuclear weapon. It has faced increasingly harsh economic sanctions designed to pressure it to meet international obligations. He said the United States respects the right of Iran to access peaceful nuclear energy, in the context of Iran meeting its obligations. The administration official said President Obama would engage in additional direct contacts with Rouhani if it would be helpful in resolving the Iranian nuclear issue. The official said the U.S. has been in touch with other governments about the conversation, including Israel and Gulf nations, and with members of Congress.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Why Pakistan Won't Go After Afghan Taliban Pakistan is hesitant to take action against the Afghan Taliban on its soil because of concerns the group will redirect its violence against Pakistan and Afghan intelligence will support it, a senior Pakistani official said. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently demanded that Pakistan either take military action against Taliban commanders on its soil or arrest them and hand them over to Kabul. Pakistan has often complained that when it launched military operations in Swat and South Waziristan in 2009, militants belonging to Pakistani Taliban took shelter in Afghanistan and started using it as a base, with the help of Afghan intelligence, to carry out operations against Pakistan. FILE - Masked Pakistani pro-Taliban militants who are supporters of Maulana Fazlullah, a hardline cleric, stand at a check post in Charbagh, a Taliban stronghold, near Mingora, the main town of Pakistan's Swat valley, Nov. 2, 2007. As recently as the start of the current operation in North Waziristan in 2014, the Pakistani official said, the Afghan government issued refugee cards to militants who escaped to the other side. Senior journalist and regional expert Rahimullah Yousufzai said the leadership of several Pakistani Taliban groups, including Mullah Fazlullah, the head of Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, was hiding in Afghanistan. He added that one of the militant leaders, Omar Khalid Khorasani, whose group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for an Easter bombing in Lahore in March that killed more than 70 people, was supposed to be getting support from the Afghan intelligence agencies. North Waziristan, Pakistan Enabling the Taliban Pakistan, he said, had created an environment that enabled the presence of both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban. In addition, he said, Pakistan scuttled opportunities presented by Afghanistan for mutual cooperation in order to change this situation. Afghan officials recently said the group has effectively taken battlefield control of the Afghan Taliban. They also blame the group for a deadly attack in Kabul in April that killed nearly 70 people. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have deteriorated over the last year, after a burst of warmth in early 2015. Officials on both sides acknowledge that they do not trust each other. Improving relations Zakhilwal said President Ashraf Ghani, after his election, took the first step toward improving relations with Pakistan but did not get anything in return. He expected Pakistan to help bring the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table. FILE - Pakistani Taliban fighters, who were arrested by Afghan border police, stand during a presentation of seized weapons and equipment to the media in Kabul, Afghanistan on January 5, 2016. A second round, scheduled for the end of July, was cancelled when news broke that the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar, who was supposed to have blessed the talks, had been dead for a few year. Efforts to rejuvenate the talks resulted in a four nation Quadrilateral Coordination Group, with representatives from the United States and China joining Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group adopted a roadmap with steps leading to a reconciliation process for peace in Afghanistan. That effort, Zakhilwal said, will also fail if Pakistan continues with its inaction. Pakistan, he indicated, was not doing any of that. Pakistan foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz on the other hand, has said that according to the road map, if peace talks do not materialize, action against the Taliban would require consensus among all QCG members. FILE - Afghan Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani, right, talks with Pakistan's National Security Adviser Sartaj Aziz, left, during their meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan, August 13, 2015. He has also said that Kabul is frustrated because of the delay in the start of the process but acknowledges such things take time. Pakistan insists it is continuing its efforts to facilitate talks. A delegation of the Afghan Taliban visited Islamabad from Qatar late last month as part of those efforts. That visit seemed to have left the Afghans more unhappy. Zakhilwal complained that Afghans found out about the delegation from their own intelligence sources.\",\n",

The sharp increase in deaths now attributed to MERS, which causes coughing, fever and pneumonia in some, means the mortality rate from the virus in Saudi Arabia is now 41 percent, instead of the 33 percent previously thought. However, the ministry said that although the total number of historical cases had risen, the rate of infection in the most recent outbreak appeared to be slowing. Of the total, 53 patients were still being treated, while 353 had recovered, the statement said. New measure The Health Ministry said it had put in place new measures to make sure better data gathering, reporting and transparency were being observed, including standardization of testing and better guidelines for labeling and storing samples. On Monday, acting health minister Adel Fakieh announced he had relieved deputy minister Ziad Memish from his post. Fakieh was appointed in April after King Abdullah sacked his predecessor Abdullah al-Rabeeah following a new MERS outbreak. Saudi authorities, including Memish, had been criticized by some international scientists for their handling of the crisis, including what they saw as a lack of collaboration with specialist laboratories offering to help investigate the outbreak. The Health Ministry said on Sunday it had set up a new command and control center to tackle MERS and any future public health crisis more effectively. The new center will work with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control, it said.',\n",

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, left, is shown the way by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after a joint press conference following their meeting at Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Oct. 26, 2016.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, front, walks with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, Oct. 20, 2016. US relations Analysts say the president may be using the Japan trip to craft a foreign policy that includes the United States, just with less dependence than in the past. The United States and the Philippines signed a Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, obligating each side to support the other if attacked by a third party.

FILE - U.S. Navy amphibious assault vehicles with Philippine and U.S. troops on board are seen during joint exercises near a beach facing one of the contested islands in the South China Sea known as the Scarborough Shoal in the West Philippine Sea. Polls show that Philippine citizens largely favor U.S. aid compared to help from China, a Communist country with poor relations in recent years because of the maritime dispute. Generous donor Japan contributes heavily to the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, which has lent the Philippines an average $745 million per year since 2006 for poverty reduction. The separately run, government-funded Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) gave the Philippines $272 million in 2006 alone. In July, the Japanese prime minister offered the Philippines a loan for 10 coast guard patrol ships. Japanese conglomerate Marubeni Corp. will make up $17.2 billion of the Japanese help pledged last week, according to Philippine media reports. That amount would cover highways, electrical power and mass transit projects. Disaster relief Aid to date is felt in spots such as the southern Philippine city Cagayan de Oro, where the cooperation agency is helping fund a flood control project, local newspaper columnist Antonio Montalvan said. Flood control became a priority after tropical storm Washi hit the city in 2011 and caused 1,250 deaths.

Charles Eboune, an international relations expert in Cameroon, was dismayed Clinton's decades of experience in Washington was not enough to carry her to victory. Change in style Now, Africans have to adjust to the fact that a president with a very different style and priorities from both Obama and Clinton is going to take office. More than a few Africans are worried about the policy changes Trump may implement. Cardboard cutouts of both candidates on display during a breakfast at the home of U.S. ambassador in Nairobi, Kenya.

       " {'content': \" Aid Groups Fear Battle for Mosul Will Be Disaster for Civilians More than 62,000 civilians are believed to have fled Mosul in recent weeks as Iraqi forces prepare for a final assault to retake the city from the Islamic State terror group. And there are growing indications they may be among the last to safely escape. Despite talk by U.S. and Iraqi officials about setting up safe routes and government-controlled screening centers to handle the flow of fleeing civilians, aid groups say they are seeing few indications Iraq is serious about making adequate preparations. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has been helping tend to almost 38,000 Iraqis who have fled from Mosul and surrounding areas at the Debaga camp, is likewise alarmed. FILE - Workers prepare a tent camp in Khazer west of the Kurdish regional capital Erbil, Iraq, Oct. 11, 2016, for people expected to flee Mosul when the battles for Mosul begins. Calamity to come? It could be a humanitarian disaster in the making. According to United Nations estimates, as many as 1.5 million people are living in Mosul, and officials expect as many as 200,000 to flee as soon as the battle for the city begins in earnest. But with the start of the final assault weeks or days away, long-sought accommodations for displaced Iraqis are lagging far behind. U.N. officials say six displacement camps have been built so far, capable of housing a total of about 50,000 people. And while there are plans to ready 11 more, humanitarian organizations are quick to point out they have received only about half of the $280 million they requested in July to meet the needs of the expected flood of civilians. Aid agencies also say as many as 800,000 civilians could flee as the fighting intensifies. And in a worst-case scenario, in which as many as 1 million people flee Mosul, a top U.N. official warns the costs would skyrocket to perhaps as much as $1 billion. This U.N. map shows expected paths of escape from Mosul Some groups say Iraqi officials are telling them the lack of preparedness for displaced civilians is one of the reasons they now want to close off all escape routes from Mosul. But Wille thinks that may be nothing more than wishful thinking. FILE - A convoy of Iraqi security forces advances on the outskirts of Mosul, Oct. 12, 2016, to fight against Islamic State militants. Trusting the Iraqis The U.S.-led coalition, which has been helping Iraqi forces prepare for the battle to retake Mosul, has consistently endorsed the way its leaders have handled the planning. Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. John Dorrian told Pentagon reporters Wednesday the Iraqi government is directing 20 camps for displaced civilians and working with humanitarian groups to pre-position resources. Other top U.S. officials have emphasized a desire to keep the plans for how to handle the civilians fleeing Mosul as quiet as possible, as long as possible. U.S. officials also suggest having civilians stay in place, also known as white flagging, during the battle for Mosul could minimize their exposure to danger. FILE - Fighters from predominantly Sunni Arab force take part in a training session before the upcoming battle to recapture Mosul in Bashiqa, Oct. 6, 2016. Doubts remain Aid groups and human rights organizations are not so sure. Already, Iraqi officials have made clear that these forces, also known as Popular Mobilization Forces, will be used to reclaim Mosul despite allegations that some of them are directly responsible for the death, torture and disappearances of hundreds of Sunni men and boys from Fallujah. U.S. officials have tried to downplay such concerns, emphasizing that any forces coming into contact with civilians will be under the control of the Iraqi government.

Yousef Munayyer, Executive Director of Washington, DC-based Jerusalem Fund, explains that in international bargaining, there is always some linkage of the issues. Pushing Iran to the top of the global agenda, says Munayyer, focuses international attention away from the peace process, where nothing has transpired.

       " {'content': \" Anti-Government Protesters Threaten to Defy Egyptian President The arrests since Thursday have involved raids on cafes and homes in the Egyptian capital. FILE - Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, speaks during a live broadcast, in Cairo, Egypt, April 13, 2016. El-Sissi sought to defuse opposition started by his declaration to hand over control of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. Analysts: el-Sissi's popularity may be slipping While no observers are suggesting Egypt is about to be plunged into the kind of chaos that shook the country in the lead-up to the 2011 Arab spring ouster of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, the very fact that protesters are ready to defy the government in large numbers despite the ban on demonstrations underscores growing public discontent with el-Sissi, say analysts. Large-scale street demonstrations virtually vanished from Egyptian streets after security forces in August 2013 killed nearly 1,000 mainly Islamist protesters. Transfer of islands increased public anger The red arrow shows the approximate location of Tiran and Sanafir islands. The sovereignty transfer of the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, a staunch el-Sissi ally, has given the protest movement new life, allowing liberals and Islamists to unite around a flashpoint issue. The government appears to have been caught by surprise by the intensity of public anger. For the protesters it appears el-Sissi gave up the islands for cash, announcing the transfer when Saudi King Salaman was in Cairo and himself announcing billions of dollars in investments, all of which will help to prop up the el-Sissi government, FILE - Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, left, shakes hands with Saudi Arabia's King Salman before he departs Egypt, April 11, 2016. Several rights and civil society organizations are being investigated for alleged crimes against the state, including seeking to destabilize it. Concern by Britain and US A court case against half-a-dozen prominent Egyptian campaigners was postponed last Wednesday during the visit to Cairo of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. But he did make an oblique reference to the deteriorating human rights situation, one that the White House has increasingly become more public in condemning in recent weeks. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, right, meets with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, center, and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, at the Presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt, April 20, 2016. The torture and death of an Italian doctoral student, Giulio Regini, who disappeared in Cairo in January has added to Western alarm. Italian officials and his mother say they suspect Egypt's security forces were behind the killing. El-Sissi answers critics (VOA/ H. Elrasam) More than 250 protesters were arrested nationwide during the April 15 protests, according to Democracy Index, a local NGO. The rights network IFEX, said it had documented 370 arrests. All protests across the country were dispersed but activists reported only minor injuries. Likewise, el-Sissi and most top officials remained relatively silent about the April 15 protests, opting to ignore them publicly. Al-Shorouk claimed el-Sissi warned his security officials that he would not accept any repetition on Sinai Liberation Day.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Cuba's Damas de Blanco, Going to Jail in Spotlight of Obama's Visit The city is steamy enough on a March night, but pack 60 people into a small living room: Handkerchiefs come out to dab glistening skin. A rotating fan whirs in the corner. The Damas de Blanco began arriving at the two-story, three-bedroom home a week earlier, coming from across the country to camp out in the house that serves as their headquarters, because they feared security officials would block them from leaving their homes ahead of a historic visit by U.S. President Barack Obama. One woman, from Guantanamo, hitched a ride with a trucker by pretending to be pregnant. Berta, the group members say. You want to talk to Berta. After her adult children and granddaughter moved to Florida last year, Soler and her husband's family in Cuba became much smaller. Still, she keeps trips to the U.S. short so she never misses a Sunday march. (V. Macchi / VOA) They need to stay ahead of what they describe as constant surveillance from security agents who target dissidents. One Dama shares a recorded video on her phone of police pouncing on her and her husband earlier this month as they exit their home in the capital with their two young children, 5 and 7. Her husband was detained. Between the two of them, they are arrested regularly enough it seems to be a full-time occupation. Opportunity to show the world There are nearly 200 official Damas de Blanco. Damas de Blanco protest in Havana, Cuba, March 20, 2016. (V. Macchi / VOA) When the group began in 2003, the women who joined were the wives, sisters, daughters and mothers of political prisoners. Now, the scope of their complaints has broadened to human rights overall. They oppose the Castro government. A silent protest. Civil disobedience. The days almost always end with some of the women and their supporters behind the bars of Cuban jails, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. She shows scars on her forearms she says came from handcuffs cinched too tightly behind her back. Nervously awaiting Obama Damas de Blanco protest in Havana, Cuba, March 20, 2016. (V. Macchi / VOA) Some are excited, some nervous. Berta also serves as the mother hen, delegating tasks. There are no pillows, and only a few sheets to go around. A few of the men sleep on cardboard to cut the chill of the tile floor. By the time everyone settles in for the night, they will get about two hours of sleep. Strange tranquillity The capital buzzes ahead of the state visit. Fresh paint goes up; roads Obama will travel on are repaved and repainted. Police deploy around the tourist areas. Cubans mull over what the trip means. An end to the embargo? No, according to officials on both sides. More U.S. business in Cuba? Likely, with deals signed this week. For 34-year-old Jacqueline Herredia-Morales, one of the Damas, it validates a government she sees as unjust. Margarita Vardena is one of the oldest Damas. At 71, she has no fear of being detained in Havana, Cuba. (V. Macchi / VOA) In white dresses and skirts and pants and T-shirts on Sunday morning, the 55 Damas file onto a public bus for the half-hour journey to the usual protest site. It is a remarkable commute in its banality. Nothing bad happens. No police stop them. They feel strong. They feel calm. But she grappled with the peacefulness this Sunday. A nice break, she said. Silent march to jail Shouting ripped into the light-heartedness of the morning. A block away, a group member and her partner were walking toward the park when plainclothed police stopped them. A fracas ensued, the woman said later over questions about ID cards. Blood dripping down over eyes wide with disbelief, her boyfriend Lazaro Yuri Valle-Roca was forced into the back of a green sedan and whisked away. Damas de Blanco protest in Havana, Cuba, March 20, 2016. (V. Macchi / VOA) For 90 minutes, the women attended Palm Sunday Mass and emerged with palm leaves knotted into crosses. Nearby, the media flocked to a shouting match between a counterprotester and a supporter of the Damas. Forever. And you should do the same. The Damas marched down the boulevard, silently as always. They returned to Parque Gandhi, along the same route as every week. And as usual, the police arrived en masse to take them to jail.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Protesters' Plans Present Challenges for Inauguration Security Preparations and security operations are well underway a month before Donald Trump's inauguration as president of the United States, which is expected to draw an unprecedented number of protesters. Though many members of the military and the National Guard have been planning this inauguration since 2012, the local armory building in Washington, D.C., opened its doors to display a large map of the city and explain the plan and movements of the president on Inauguration Day. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will start at St. John's Episcopal Church, after which they will head to the White House to meet with outgoing President Barack Obama, who will hand Trump a physical, albeit symbolic, key to the White House. After administrative documents are signed, a motorcade will begin from the White House to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. Reporters interview officials on the inaugural preparations being made by the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region for military and civilian planners at the D.C. Armory in Washington, Dec. 14, 2016. Contingency plans The Joint Force Committee, which includes members of the military and some District of Columbia National Guard members, cited the most basic, but also the most real, threats to the inauguration parade: getting all their members properly credentialed, and having a contingency plan for hundreds of thousands of people in case of inclement weather. Thousands of National Guard members will be deputized by the D.C. Police Department, giving them the power to make arrests. Though the deputization has been common practice, arrests are rarely made. At Obama's first inauguration in 2009, which saw one of the largest crowds in history, troops made no arrests, said Major General Errol Schwartz, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard. Because the events of Inauguration Day largely take place outdoors and in January, weather also is a pressing concern. Military personnel have three uniforms for inclement weather. Their commander will decide at 4:30 a.m. January 20 which one they will wear. In 1985 at Ronald Reagan's second inauguration, the ceremony outside the Capitol was canceled because of snow, wind, and record low temperatures; it took place inside the building instead. As Trump prepares to take office, though, police, military and security personnel are facing an added challenge. Women march against U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 13, 2016. Women's march According to a Facebook event page, hundreds of thousands of people plan to participate in the Women's March on Washington the day after the inauguration. The march, the largest of more than a dozen planned in Washington over inauguration weekend, was the first to receive its permit Friday. The ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) coalition is one of many groups seeking permits to protest on Inauguration Day. Nearly 20,000 people have RSVP'd on the group's website. Construction continues on the inaugural platform in preparation for the swearing-in ceremonies for President-elect Donald Trump on the Capitol steps in Washington, Dec. 8, 2016. Many pro-Trump groups also are expected to convene to watch the inauguration in Washington. One of those is Bikers for Trump, made up of motorcyclists who staged rallies throughout the country leading up to the election, and who plan to ride through the city on Inauguration Day. A GoFundMe campaign for Bikers for Trump has raised over $18,000 to pay for lodging and fuel for those riding to and through Washington. Demonstrations set As many as 1 million protesters, on various sides and from various groups, could make it to the inauguration or gather the day after, according to calculations by Stephen Fuller, professor and faculty chair at the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. Hotels throughout the capital are almost fully booked just with just those expected attendees, but Fuller said many protesters would either be making day trips or finding alternate lodging. Can we stay with you?' A model of the Capitol is displayed on a giant planning map during a media tour highlighting inaugural preparations being made by the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region for military and civilian planners at the D.C. Armory in Washington, Dec. 14, 2016. Though the number of protesters expected in Washington is unprecedented, Fuller said, the general number of attendees, in whatever capacity, is similar to the number for Obama's inauguration in 2009. It's therefore a crowd size that local and federal authorities are equipped to deal with. Directional signs are displayed on a giant planning map during a media tour highlighting inaugural preparations being made by the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region for military and civilian planners at the D.C. Armory in Washington, Dec. 14, 2016. The National Park Service is in charge of clearing permits for protests, because most of them occur on the National Mall and around monuments. The reason many demonstrations still lack permits is that the sheer number of groups protesting presents new challenges to the park service, not to mention security forces that will have a harder time keeping the large influx of people within designated areas, as well as quelling any potential tension between them and supporters of the new administration.\",\n",

The anti-Assad rebel pocket in the east has now been split into two after regime forces captured the district of Sakhour, according to independent monitors as well as Syrian government officials. Sakhur, Hanano and Jabal Badro districts in Aleppo, Syria Rami Abdulrahman, director of the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of monitors on the ground, estimates that opposition militias have lost more than third of the area they controlled in Aleppo city since the regime renewed an offensive in September. That land-grab owes much to Russian intervention. According to Nawar Oliver of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies, an Istanbul-based think tank, Russian warplanes have mounted 3,359 airstrikes on Aleppo province in the past three months. Each collapsed house and rubble-strewn street is being fought over time and again. The assault on eastern Aleppo is taking its toll of government forces. A man covers his face from dust as he walks with a bicycle after a strike on the rebel held besieged al-Shaar neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, Nov. 26, 2016. Last week. For the rebels, bravado goes hand-in-hand with the desperate resistance the insurgents have mounted since a Russian-backed offensive in February across northern Syria left eastern Aleppo encircled. The rebels have mounted major counter-attacks in recent weeks as they have battled to hold on to districts that first fell to them four years ago.

And there seems little hope that Turkish-backed rebels fighting northeast of Aleppo against Kurdish militias and the Islamic State will be able to assist their comrades in the city. If the rebels fold in eastern Aleppo, beaten into defeat by overwhelming numbers and scorched-earth airstrikes, what then? In the south nothing is happening. The commanders down there tell me the situation is very bad. They lack ammunition and outside support and all they can do is just hang on.

       " {'content': \" (Salah Ashkar via AP) Zeid's comments came after heavy fighting resumed Wednesday in Aleppo and various parties and their backers traded blame for shattering a cease-fire, effectively scuttling a plan to evacuate civilians and rebels. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the violence included airstrikes on the remaining parts of opposition-held Aleppo, which the rebels seized four years ago. Rebel areas were also hit by shelling, while Syrian state television reported that shelling by the rebels killed six people in a district that was recently recaptured by the government. Syrian pro-government forces walk in Aleppo's Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood after they captured the area in the eastern part of the war torn city, Dec. 13, 2016. Trading blame Russia blamed the rebels for breaking the truce agreed to on Tuesday, saying they attacked Syrian government positions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it was government forces who attacked first. Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin were due to discuss the situation in Aleppo sometime Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, spoke by phone Wednesday afternoon and Lavrov told Kerry the Syrian government was willing to provide a safe exit for civilians and rebel fighters, but the rebels refused to adhere to the ceasefire, according to a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey, which supports rebels who want to oust him, brokered the deal, which also set up the evacuations that were expected to begin early Wednesday morning. Aleppo has been the subject of numerous efforts to bring a halt in fighting and to get aid to thousands of people in need of food and medicine. But repeatedly those initiatives, including brokered cease-fires by countries such as Russia, the United States and Turkey, have fallen apart. The plan, according to Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, was for most of the fleeing opposition fighters to move to Idlib, a city of 165,000 residents 60 kilometers southwest of Aleppo. Buses wait to evacuate people from a rebel pocket in Aleppo, in the government-controlled al-Hamadaniah Stadium of Aleppo, Syria Dec. 14, 2016. Turkey's deputy prime minister, Mehmet Simsek, said on Twitter his country would set up a tent city to accommodate as many as 80,000 refugees fleeing Aleppo. Failed diplomacy At an emergency council session Tuesday, Western envoys fiercely criticized Russia for its ongoing military support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the months of atrocities inflicted on residents of the once-vibrant city. Ambassador Samantha Power asked. Atrocities Earlier, in Geneva, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville called on Syria to allow U.N. monitors or another organization such as the International Committee of the Red Cross immediate access to Aleppo. In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, a Syrian soldier carries a wounded woman in eastern Aleppo, Syria, Dec. 12, 2016. Rebel commanders and opposition politicians insist the loss of Aleppo will not mark the end of the uprising. However, few doubt battlefield fortunes have swung heavily against them and with the regime possibly hours away from seizing what is left of insurgent controlled eastern Aleppo, the dynamic of resistance will have to change to guerrilla warfare to keep the revolution alive.

The dead included women and children, some of them infants. Click to enlarge Based on eyewitness testimony of survivors who saw or heard government and pro-government forces detain and then execute their relatives, the 68-page HRW report suggests the majority of those killed, generally by three bullets to the head, were non-combatants executed several hours after firefights between the army and rebels had ended. According to the survivors, government forces started to ransack and loot houses early in the afternoon, and then rounded up the men, separating them from the women and children. The men were either shot on the spot or moved to the main square and shot there. The bodies were later moved to a mobile phone store where they were partially burned, the HRW report said. Surviving relatives describe killings Among the dead were the four grown sons of 70-year-old Mustafa Suweid. Samira, the wife of one of the sons, said the four were forced into a next-door apartment along with a neighbor. Each of the men had three bullets in him. Ahmad was not yet dead. But we were unable to get him to a hospital. He died two hours later. We moved the bodies into one room and covered them. Nearby, soldiers entered the home of the Bayasi family, the HRW report said. A local resident, Majed, who was among the first to discover the corpses also shared his grisly story with HRW. As we entered further into the house, we got to a room where we found so many corpses. Mothers and children piled on top of each other. One mother was still covering her son. I thought he may have survived, but as I turned her over, I saw that he had been also shot. The HRW report also detailed a separate incident in which the wife of a man called Muhammad Shaker said she found her husband with bullet wounds to his head and shoulder. Cell phone video The Human Rights Watch report includes cell phone video recordings made by survivors to support much of the testimony gathered by HRW. HRW investigators also spoke to survivors who discovered the bodies in the cell phone store in al-Bayda. This citizen journalist image provided by The Syrian Revolution against Bashar Assad, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, shows Syrian army soldiers standing in front of dead bodies at Bayda village. There were more than 60 dead bodies there. They were all next to each other and all burnt. According to HRW, similar summary executions took place in Baniyas, 10 kilometers from al-Bayda, where local residents named 30 men, 22 women, and 29 children who had been executed. Conventional weapons used Earlier this week, the United Nations commission charged with investigating human rights violations in Syria released an updated version of its findings listing a number of violations committed by both the rebels and Assad government forces.

They had thought his views would come to align more closely with those of some of his top national security nominees, such as likely defense secretary retired Gen.

Will his Tweets and off-the-cuff remarks be translated into policy? Wait-and-see strategy Some Europeans favor a wait-and-see strategy. The characteristically guarded German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, limited herself to a few terse comments about the interview, and did not respond directly to Trump's assertion that her refugee policy has been a disaster. German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends a joint news conference as part of a meeting with the Prime Minister of New Zealand Bill English, at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 16, 2017.

The report said globally divisive politics has also been marked by governments turning on refugees and migrants. He also pointed to the decline in U.S. influence over the past decade. Myanmar Amnesty International said Myanmar faced reversals in human rights despite the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi coming to power in early 2016. Patel said the reversals include the harassment of rights activists and military operations in western Rakhine State against Muslim Rohingya.

Myanmar security forces mounted a major sweep through the region after an attack in October on guards at a checkpoint by suspected Rohingya attackers. Former Myanmar political prisoner Bo Kyi said the Myanmar government, while facing several challenges, believes the rights picture is more mixed. The Suu Kyi led government released dozens of political prisoners early last year. But Bo Kyi, a member of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), said 86 prisoners of conscience remain in jail, with 200 others facing charges. Cambodia These have included tighter laws governing elections and harassment of those in civil society. Amnesty accused Cambodian authorities of misusing the justice system and the punishing of civil society and the silencing of critics.

FILE - Demonstrators chant around a car during a demonstration against Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump after his campaign rally in San Jose, California, June 2, 2016. Security cooperation For the past 18 months, the Secret Service has been collaborating with numerous local and federal law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prepare for the conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia. City Hall in Philadelphia, June 20, 2016. Like the law enforcement agencies, Bulla said some protesters devote a lot of time to train as well. As the agencies plan how to deploy their equipment so, too, do anarchists. They may stash caches of weapons ahead of time in trash receptacles, planters or newspaper racks, Bulla said. Priorities Despite recent high-profile terrorist attacks in Orlando, Florida and Brussels, Belgium, Bulla said the threat of terrorist attacks does not rank as high as threats of cyber attacks and civil disobedience. FILE - An Orange County Sheriff's Department SWAT member arrives to the scene of a fatal shooting at Pulse Orlando nightclub in Orlando, Florida, June 12, 2016. Bulla, however, warned that previous terrorist attacks can inspire new ones. In the absence of threats, Bulla said law enforcers spend considerable time planning for bomb threats, minor medical emergencies and minor criminal activity such as pickpocketing, fraud, vandalism, fighting and disorderly conduct. Uniformed and plainclothes officers first arrive on the scene, followed by horse mounted and bicycle officers. Mobile field forces, commonly known as riot police, will be on standby in both cities with armored vehicles and other riot control equipment. Demonstrators control Cleveland city officials plan to enforce strict rules to control demonstrators. The city will limit marches to 50 minutes, primarily during the morning hours before delegates convene. The planned parade route for demonstrators crosses a bridge in a direction away from Quicken Loans Arena, the convention site. Officials say an unspecified area around the arena will be cordoned off. The rules would have banned items such as large backpacks, adhesive tape and string. They would have also limited where demonstrators could speak within the zone. Cleveland officials say they will appeal the ruling. Temporary structures go up outside the Wells Fargo Center ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, June 20, 2016. Officials in Philadelphia are taking a different approach than their counterparts in Cleveland. Philadelphia will allow supporters of long shot Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to rally throughout the day in a park across the street from the convention site at Wells Fargo Arena. The arena will be protected by a newly constructed perimeter more than 1.5 meters high. Thousands of Sanders supporters are expected to congregate in Philadelphia for the convention on July 25 to 28. Through demonstrations, they hope to convince the party establishment to reform the presidential nominating process by rejecting the growing influence of corporations in the electoral process. FILE - Supporters gather to see U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speak during a election night rally in Santa Monica, California, June 7, 2016.

       " {'content': \" Clinton, Trump Clash Over Strategy to Defeat IS The U.S. strategy against Islamic State extremists figured prominently in the first presidential debate Monday night. The candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton, 68, and Republican Donald Trump, 70, offered starkly different takes on defeating the extremist group, raising the question: How accurate were their comments on IS? To find out, VOA asked a few experts to evaluate the candidates' statements on IS. Clinton on IS in Iraq The U.S.-led coalition has been helping a combination of Iraqi, Kurdish and Arab forces fight IS in Iraq. IS has been mostly rooted out of Anbar province and the coalition is setting its sights on a big battle for Mosul, currently an IS stronghold in Iraq. Analysts and commanders on the ground say Clinton is likely overly optimistic in saying that IS will be uprooted from Iraq in a year. FILE - Hundreds of civilians flee villages outside Mosul a day after Iraqi Kurdish forces launched an operation east of Islamic State-held Mosul, Aug. 15, 2016. Dlawar Ala' Aldeen, founding president of the Middle East Research Institute, said it could take generations before Islamic State militants are completely defeated in Iraq. FILE - Fighters with the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also called ISIS by some) wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa province, northern Syria, June 30, 2014. Trump on Clinton's failure to curb IS The timeline of the birth of the group and its rise does not support this claim. IS was created following the withdrawal of the majority of U.S troops in Iraq in 2013. A year later, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi formally declared an Islamic caliphate after fighting the Iraqi army and rapidly taking control of territory in both Iraq and Syria. Clinton was 66 years old when al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate. FILE - This image from video posted in July purports to show Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivering a sermon in Iraq. Clinton on combating IS online This policy is similar to an Obama administration initiative already in place. The State Department recently announced that it has begun working with private-sector partners on a program to combat the group's extremist messaging on social media platforms. It is partnering with an affiliate of Google to disrupt IS online recruiting efforts by targeting advertising, algorithms and the use of YouTube's video platform. Trump on IS oil On the campaign trail, Trump has often made the argument that IS would be unable to launch deadly attacks if they didn't control oil fields in Iraq. He has said that President Barack Obama should have given the order to seize IS oil operations, cutting off its lucrative smuggling business that helped fund the group. But, under international law, the United States cannot seize Iraq's oil. U.S. forces have also targeted IS oil production facilities, leading to IS militants losing control of some oil fields. FILE - Iraqi security forces patrol as smoke rises from burning oil wells in Qayara, south of Mosul, Iraq, Aug. 31, 2016. But he has yet to outline in detail his plan to combat IS as president, saying he doesn't want to tip off the enemy. But when pressed by Clinton during the debate, Trump did not take the opportunity to disclose more details. Trump on IS in more than 30 countries Now it is in over 30 countries and you are going to stop them? It is hard to assess IS's presence in varying parts of the world, according to experts. Mainly in Iraq and Syria, IS claims on its website that it has ties to 26 countries. IS has also claimed responsibility for terror attacks that are sometimes lone-wolf incidents. Law enforcement officials say those links are more ideological than direct. Clinton on targeting IS leadership Since the beginning of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against IS, dozens in the IS hierarchy have been killed in airstrikes and drone raids. Chief IS spokesperson Abu Mohammad al-Adnani was killed in a U.S. strike in August. In July, the U.S. targeted two senior commanders: Basim Muhammad Ahmad Sultan al-Bajari, the terror group's deputy minister of war, and Hatim Talib al-Hamduni, an IS military commander in Mosul. Also, Abu Omar al-Shishani, IS minister of war, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in March. In another strike in the same month, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, IS minister of finance, was killed.

       " {'content': \" At Summit of Americas, US Faces Charged Environment FILE - U.S. President Barack Obama can expect various factions at summit. Obama's participation in this year's Summit of the Americas comes as his administration seeks to normalize relations with Cuba but also as it takes a tough stand against the government of Venezuela and its harsh attempts to silence dissent in the oil-rich but economically struggling nation. The U.S. is clearly the biggest economic power and, as such, the most influential voice in the hemisphere. But its sway over Latin America is limited. Even U.S. allies have not been ready to march in lockstep with their big neighbor to the north. Among the leading players in this summit: Cuba: After half a century of U.S.-Cuban estrangement, any engagement between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro will be historic. FILE - Raul Castro leads Cuba, which seeks removal from U.S. list of terrorists. Although the White House says the two leaders will surely interact while attending the summit, no formal bilateral meetings had been scheduled ahead of the trip. Obama on Wednesday said the State Department had finished its review of whether to remove Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. He said he would act soon after receiving a formal recommendation. Cuba's removal from the list has long been anticipated, and Obama for months has signaled he's prepared to take that step once he received a formal recommendation. Havana has eagerly sought removal from the list as part of a reopening of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. All eyes will be on the two leaders and on whether Obama announces Cuba's removal from the terror-sponsor list. Hopes ran high in the initial days after the December 17 announcement that the U.S. and Cuba could move quickly toward normalized ties. In the initial days, there was a flurry of activity: an exchange of prisoners, intensive meetings in Havana and looser restrictions on travel and trade. Since then, the pace appears to have slowed. The U.S. had hoped to reopen an embassy in Havana before the summit, but that has not yet materialized. Venezuela FILE - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a meeting at Miraflores Palace in Caracas.. Obama recently slapped sanctions on seven leading Venezuelans in protest over President Nicolas Maduro's crackdown on dissidents. In so doing, the administration described Venezuela as a threat to U.S. security. That's just boilerplate language when imposing sanctions, the U.S. says. But Maduro, facing increasing economic pressure as oil prices have plummeted, has used the designation as an anti-U.S. rallying cry. Obama's challenge is to prevent the summit from being overshadowed by U.S. tensions with Venezuela, which have irked other Latin American nations and increased the pressure on the U.S. to back up its outreach to Cuba with some tangible results. The timing of the sanctions has made it harder and I wonder what the urgency was,'' said Carl Meacham, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But Shannon O'Neil, Latin American expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Maduro wants to highlight the sanctions to overshadow changes in U.S.-Cuba relations and his own economic and political troubles. ALBA nations These are the countries in the 12-member Bolivarian Alliance, a coalition of center-left countries in Latin America and the Caribbean known as ALBA. Together, they represent the face of opposition to the United States. Their members include Maduro of Venezuela, Castro of Cuba, and Presidents Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Evo Morales of Bolivia. Member countries also include Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Grenanda and St. Kitts and Nevis joined in December. Most recently, alliance members have banded in support of Venezuela, denouncing the U.S. sanctions against the seven Venezuelans and claiming that the Obama administration is trying to undermine Maduro. And then you're going to have countries that support what the United States is doing but may not be as vocal in their support of the United States because of the sanctions.'' SICA nations These are the eight countries that comprise the Central American Integration System, known as SICA for its Spanish acronym. Obama plans to meet with SICA leaders Friday to highlight U.S. economic efforts in the region. Key to him are three group members in particular: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The remaining members include Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Panama. Obama has included a $1 billion assistance package to the region in his 2016 budget request, prompted in part by last year's increase in the number of unaccompanied minors from Central America who turned up at the Texas border. The U.S. aid aims to improve economies and security. The murder rates in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are among the five highest in the world. Obama's meeting with the SICA heads of state follows a meeting last month by Vice President Joe Biden in Guatemala to discuss government reforms and investments. Brazil Despite winning 52 percent of the vote in her re-election last fall, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is facing vocal calls for her resignation or impeachment amid a major corruption scandal and dour economic straits. Brazil's currency has plunged roughly 18 percent against the dollar this year and economic growth has been virtually nonexistent. Any interaction between Obama and Rousseff will be their most significant encounter since Rousseff learned last year that the National Security Agency had spied on her communications. Those revelations leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden infuriated the Brazilian leader, who canceled a visit to Washington in protest. The White House has insisted that the rift has been mended. Biden extended a new invitation for Rousseff to visit when he spoke to her by phone last month, but Rousseff isn't expected to decide whether to accept the invitation until after the summit. Argentina FILE - Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . President Cristina Fernandez was once one of Obama's more vocal fans, but these days the U.S. president might prefer that Fernandez just keep quiet. The first woman elected president of Argentina, Fernandez as well as her administration has been rocked by the strange death of a prosecutor who had made allegations against her. A federal appeals court has thrown out the case, and Fernandez has always denied the allegations. Still, the controversy has damaged Fernandez's credibility and her popularity has taken a hit. Obama may be more concerned about a long-running debt dispute with Argentina. The dispute dates back to the country's 2001 default on $100 billion and rose all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court when a group of U.S. hedge fund managers demanded full payment. The high court ruled against Argentina, affirming that the country must first settle debt with a small group of hedge funds before making interest payments on debt owed to other lenders; a day later, the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Argentina's rating to junk status.\",\n",

Home to five debates The second of three U.S. presidential debates between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump will be held Sunday night, making it the fifth time a presidential debate has been held at Washington University in St. Louis. Students playing the roles of the candidates go through a rehearsal for the second 2016 U.S. presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Oct. 8, 2016. Commission employees have been working all week to turn the athletic facility at Washington University in St. Louis into a debate hall. The stage floor is covered in a blue carpet with a double red ring containing white stars.At the center of the ring are two bar stools. Republican Trump will sit on the left; Democrat Clinton on the right. On both sides of the stage are 20 chairs for the undecided voters who will ask the questions in a town hall debate format. The two moderators will sit at a round table at the front of the stage, facing the candidates. Video firestorm The debate has nearly been overshadowed by a controversy surrounding a video of Republican Donald Trump. The video, obtained by The Washington Post, is off-camera banter between Trump and a male TV entertainment host. In the 2005 video, Trump uses lewd comments about his conquests with women.It has set off a call for Trump to resign his nomination for the presidency. Trump issued a video apology late Friday night and has said that there is no chance he will step down. YouTube screen grab from video obtained by The Washington Post of lewd conversation about women between Donald Trump and Billy Bush. Gallop is a fervent Hillary Clinton supporter. She said her choice was once again confirmed with the new video released Friday night. Reactions from other college students were also quick and decisive. But Republican Grant Koby disagrees. Up until Friday night, he was ready to pull the lever for Trump. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true Gateway to the West People walk by the second presidential debate site at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Oct. 8, 2016.

       " {'content': \" After New Hampshire Win, Sanders, Trump Eye Next Primary Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders and outspoken Republican billionaire Donald Trump coasted to big victories in their respective party presidential primaries in New Hampshire on Tuesday, but the focus of the U.S. presidential campaign quickly moved to upcoming votes in South Carolina and Nevada. Sanders, a Vermont senator, routed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton by a 60 - 38 percent margin in neighboring New Hampshire. Trump collected 35 percent of the Republican vote, more than double that of his nearest challenger, Ohio Governor John Kasich, with even bigger margins over several other challengers. The New Hampshire outcome winnowed the large Republican field of candidates, with former technology executive Carly Fiorina, the seventh place finisher in the primary, and the sixth place contender, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, announcing they have dropped out. With his wife Karen at his side Republican presidential candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich cheers with supporters, Feb. 9, 2016, in Concord, N.H., at his primary night rally. All of the top contenders immediately eyed the next party contests on February 20, when Republicans hold a primary election in South Carolina, a conservative state along the Atlantic coast, and Democrats hold party caucuses in the western state of Nevada, best known as the country's gambling center. Three days later, Republicans have their caucuses set for Nevada, while Democrats will hold their South Carolina primary on February 27. The flamboyant Trump has routinely belittled his opponents, especially former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the son and brother of two U.S. presidents who finished fourth in the New Hampshire voting behind a conservative firebrand, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Republican presidential candidate, businessman Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a primary night rally, Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2016, in Manchester, N.H. At his side are his wife Melania Trump, left, and daughter Ivanka Trump, right. Moving on to South Carolina Early political surveys in South Carolina show Trump with a big lead over Cruz in a state long accustomed to tough political battles in Republican presidential campaigns. In the Democratic race there, Clinton is holding a large edge over Sanders, largely because of her support from black voters, who are expected to comprise a large part of the electorate in the state's Democratic primary. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., right, accompanied by Rev. Al Sharpton, raises a fist as he arrives for a breakfast meeting at Sylvia's Restaurant, Feb. 10, 2016, in the Harlem neighborhood of New York. Even with Sanders's New Hampshire win, U.S. political analysts still say Clinton will eventually be the Democratic candidate in next November's national election to pick the successor to President Barack Obama, who leaves office next January. Clinton concedes to Sanders After her trouncing in New Hampshire, Clinton, the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, conceded to Sanders, even as she pressed her contention that his proposals are unlikely to be enacted in politically fractious Washington. Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is accompanied by her daughter Chelsea Clinton (R) and her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, as she speaks to supporters at her final 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary night rally. They're hungry for solutions. What are we going to do? The New Hampshire results were in line with recent opinion polls which showed Sanders and Trump with comfortable, double digit leads over their rivals.

       " {'content': \" What's Hiding Behind Russia's Calls for Peace in Nagorno-Karabakh Since the end of separatist war in 1994, the region has de facto been under the control of the local Armenian forces and the Armenian military, and low-level armed clashes have occasionally broken out. Moscow and Tehran are facilitating the peace talks between the warring sides as Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating the cease-fire, reached last week after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Lavrov spoke by telephone. The United States encouraged Armenia and Azerbaijan to resume peace talks and avoid further escalation. History of conflict The fighting that erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh last weekend is the worst outbreak of violence in the history of the conflict. According to The Associated Press, at least 64 people were killed in the fighting. FILE - A tank of the self-defense army of Nagorno-Karabakh moves on the road near the village of Mataghis, April 6, 2016. Despite its public posture of being committed to resolving the conflict, he said, Moscow continues to play a double game, trying to use the recent escalation of violence to its advantage. IS allegation On April 4, one day before Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to stop fighting after several days of intense combat, LifeNews, a Russia-based TV station, aired a program alleging that Azeri forces were using Islamic State fighters in the battle in Nagorno-Karabakh. The report claimed that Azerbaijani IS militants in Syria had crossed Turkish territory to reach Azerbaijan and join the fight against the Armenians in the contested territory. FILE - Armenian soldiers aim a howitzer, April 3, 2016, in the village of Mardakert, in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ministry added that any member of a terrorist organization who attempted to enter Azerbaijan for any reason would be prosecuted. Following the LifeNews report, its TV crew in Azerbaijan was expelled from the country. Secular state According to the Soufan Group, a New York City-based security consulting firm, 216 Azerbaijani citizens joined IS in Iraq and Syria, 49 of whom returned home. Forty of the latter were reportedly arrested after returning to Azerbaijan. People walk during a march to commemorate Armenian servicemen killed in recent clashes over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region in Yerevan, Armenia, April 10, 2016. The cause is to be found in Azerbaijan itself. We are pressured and not accepted as people. The media speaks against us, calling us Wahhabis. The police shave our beards. Station owner denounces Azerbaijan Although Gabrielyanov, who is at the helm of a growing media empire in Russia, denies any ties to the Russian government, his loyalty to President Putin is no secret. People take part in a rally in support of Azerbaijan over the conflict in the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, outside the Armenian embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 8, 2016. Questions news report Like Shevchenko, Goble questions the veracity of the LifeNews report alleging the involvement of Azeri IS militants in the Nagorno-Karabakh fighting. Two days before the sides reached a cease-fire, an IS-style video appeared on the Internet claiming to show the beheading of an Armenian Yezidi soldier by a person wearing an Azeri military uniform. In the video, which was posted on VKontakte, a Russian social network similar to Facebook, the person in the uniform is holding what appears to be a head in his hands. VOA could not verify the veracity of the video. Azerbaijani officials said it was fabricated. LifeNews, however, said the video supports its claims that IS militants are fighting on the Azeri side in Nagorno-Karabakh.\",\n",

Turkey says it issued repeated warnings that the plane was in its airspace before shooting it down. Meanwhile, the war of words between Moscow and Ankara continued. Putin said the downing of its plane by Turkey was an act of betrayal by a country Russia had thought of as a friendly state. Russia announced Wednesday it is sending S-400 missile system to Syria's Latakia province, which borders Turkey. Putin asked rhetorically. In an interview with CNN, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would not apologize for downing the jet.

Russia is tightening restrictions on Turkish imports as tensions remain high between the two countries. Islamic State oil He demanded anyone accusing Turkey of buying from the militants show proof of their accusations. He also said Turkey was taking precautions to stop oil smuggling at its borders, which has been a key source of revenue for the militant group. But Putin said that lines of oil tankers have been observed taking oil from Syria to Turkey and returning empty. Russia cuts hotline Russia also said it would subject Turkish food imports to extra scrutiny. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, center rear, at a government meeting in Moscow, Russia, Nov. 26, 2015. Medvedev ordered measures drawn up that would include freezing some joint investment projects with Turkey. Following the order, Russian media reported that trucks carrying Turkish goods were stranded at the border. The step is similar to the apparently punitive restrictions Russia has placed on other countries following disagreements over foreign policy issues in recent years. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said Thursday that Moscow would be looking to cut economic ties with Turkey and scrap investment projects in a matter of days. Russian officials have disputed Turkey's claim that the plane had violated Turkish airspace and was warned repeatedly before being brought down. It was the first time in a half-century that a NATO member shot down a Russian plane. This frame grab from video by Haberturk TV, shows a Russian warplane on fire before crashing on a hill as seen from Hatay province, Turkey, Nov. 24, 2015. One of the pilots who parachuted from Su-24 arrived Wednesday at a Russian base in Latakia after being rescued by members of the Syrian army. He was reportedly shot by rebels while parachuting toward the ground. Audio recordings However, Turkey released audio recordings of what it said are the Turkish military's repeated warnings to the pilot of the Russian plane before it was shot down at the border with Syria -- audio that grows increasingly more agitated. The recordings, made available to The Associated Press on Thursday, indicate the plane was warned several times Tuesday that it was approaching Turkey's airspace and asked to change course. You are approaching Turkish airspace. Most of the audio is garbled and barely comprehensible but the tone of the voice gets more agitated as the warnings appear to go unnoticed. The audio that was released only involved Turkish warnings, no replies by a Russian pilot. It was not clear if Russian replies were received but not released by the Turkish government, or if the Russian pilots never replied to the warnings or if they never heard the warnings. Security threat Earlier this week, Erdogan said his country was simply defending its security when it shot down the plane. While Erdogan and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said they do not wish to escalate tensions with Moscow, Russia has announced several responses to the downing. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday the military will send its advanced S-400 missile system to Syria's Latakia province, which borders Turkey. It is also deploying the guided missile cruiser Moskva to the area.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Trump, Clinton Expect Big Wins in New York Both contenders have deep roots in New York and victories would give their campaigns a boost after recent setbacks. Public opinion polls give Trump a huge lead in New York, topping 50 percent of the vote in some surveys. Trump was upset after Cruz lined up the support of delegates in Colorado and fired off a new round of salvos at the Republican establishment over rules governing delegate selection that Trump believes are unfair. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, April 11, 2016. They talk about delegates. Cruz fired back at Trump at a rally in Irvine, California, saying the New York billionaire is whining and is trying to bully the party and intimidate delegates. Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at a rally in Irvine, California, April 11, 2016. Kasich seeks to be relevant Cruz is running well behind Trump in New York as is Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has cast himself as an optimistic alternative to his two rivals. Republican presidential candidate John Kasich speaks at the Women's National Republican Club in New York, April 12, 2016. Kasich apparently hopes to hang in the race until the national convention in Cleveland in July and be available as an alternative candidate should Trump stumble and not win the nomination outright on the first ballot. Anti-Trump forces within the Republican Party are bracing for a big Trump victory in New York on Tuesday and the possibility of more Trump triumphs April 26 when primaries are held in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. One key Republican who apparently will not be part of blocking Trump is House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan sought to quell speculation this week that he might be available as a compromise candidate if the Republican convention in July becomes deadlocked. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., addresses reporters at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, ruling himself out of the Republican presidential race once and for all, April 12, 2016. Clinton leads testy Democratic race The Democratic race in New York is a battle between two contenders with deep roots there. Front-runner Hillary Clinton represented the Empire State in the Senate, while rival Bernie Sanders was born and brought up in Brooklyn. Public opinion polls show Clinton holding a steady lead in New York and in several surveys, it is a double-digit edge. The New York campaign has intensified the competition between the two Democrats and both contenders have been more aggressive in calling out the other. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton greets people at the Jackson Diner in the Queens borough of New York, April 11, 2016. Sanders was vague on how he would rein in the big banks in an interview with the New York Daily News. Sanders still draws crowds and money Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally in Washington Square Park in New York City, April 13, 2016 Coming into the New York campaign, a lot of the focus was on the rough-and-tumble Republican nomination battle. Analysts, however, note that the Democratic campaign has also reached a new level of acrimony. If Clinton can pull off a convincing win in New York on Tuesday and follow up with victories in the five northeastern primaries set for April 26, she will no doubt increase the pressure on the Sanders campaign to move toward the prospect of uniting behind Clinton as the nominee and begin to focus more seriously on the Republicans for the general election campaign.\",\n",

Donna Schaper, senior minister at Judson Memorial Church in New York and co-founder of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City, spends her days helping New York City's undocumented immigrant community. President Barack Obama also targeted undocumented immigrants with criminal records and deported a record 2.5 million people in his two terms in office. The PICO Network, a coalition of faith communities that provide sanctuary, says five people are currently being sheltered in coalition churches as they fight to stop Obama administration deportation orders. The cases are in Denver, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Chicago. Sanctuary, then and now Today, millions of undocumented immigrants from all walks of life can seek sanctuary. In New York City alone, 1 in 3 residents was born outside the United States, and half a million are undocumented. Immigrant-friendly organizations that played a role in protecting immigrants more than 36 years ago are again overburdened with requests. Like 40 other cities and 364 counties nationwide, New York is a sanctuary city. Proponents of tougher immigration laws, like Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, object to the sanctuary cities.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had encouraged aiding the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, following a meeting Monday in Vienna with diplomats from 20 other Western countries. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, left, speaks to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry prior to their news conference in Vienna, Austria, May 17, 2016. The United Nations had imposed an arms embargo in 2011 to stop strongman Moammar Gadhafi from securing weapons to quell the uprising against him. He was killed in October of that year. Kerry argued that acceding to a GNA request for arms and training is imperative to help restore order to the country. The GNA is in Tripoli; the rival government is in Tobruk. A member of the force assigned to protect Libya's unity government stands at the entrance to where the government has their offices, in Tripoli, Libya, April 14, 2016. In a series of angry tweets, Haftar supporters condemned the West's readiness to lift the arms embargo and aid the GNA. Race to consolidate power Smoke billows from a factory after an airstrike by forces loyal to former general Khalifa Haftar, in Benghazi, Libya, Oct. 22, 2014. The Gadhafi-era general and his forces have made gains in recent weeks against IS and other militants in Benghazi, Derna and Ajdabiya. Stability elusive Stabilizing Libya is an urgent goal for the West as it tries to combat IS more effectively and counter the smuggling of migrants to Europe. Western officials have placed hope in war fatigue, the allure of foreign aid and development money, and the growing threat of IS to build popular momentum for the unity government. Libya UN deal unfulfilled But the GNA has struggled to consolidate its position in the Libyan capital, let alone expand its authority to the rest of the country. It remains dependent on the support of powerful western militias, whose loyalty remains suspect and who may be biding their time to see how the unity government fares. The HoR has failed to endorse the GNA, a move required under the U.N. deal. He warned that by giving arms to the Tripoli-based GNA government, the West would essentially be taking sides in what in effect is a civil war. Migrants who'd attempted to flee to Europe wait in Libyan coast guard detention in the coastal city of Tripoli, Libya, May 16, 2016.

Alarm is rising about the prospects for civilians caught in the middle of the battle to retake the Islamic State's last major urban stronghold in Iraq. It's likely to take weeks, if not months. On Tuesday, Iraqi and Kurdish leaders told Filippo Grandi, the U.N.'s refugee commissioner, that they would do their best to protect civilians. The United Nations and the government have support materials for up to 400,000 displaced in the fight for Mosul. At least 1 million civilians are estimated to be in the city.

Meanwhile, Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, said he was deeply concerned about the rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis in Mosul, and the heightened threat to the health and lives of pregnant women who may be cut off from lifesaving emergency obstetric care. Osotimehin said that among the 200,000 people likely to be displaced during the initial weeks of military operations in Mosul, an estimated 46,000 are women and girls of reproductive age; about 8,000 are pregnant, and some are about to give birth. He added that lifesaving health services must be maintained and accessible to all who require them. Unpredictable IS fighters Militants have fanned out in Mosul, and residents contacted by phone said the center was eerily quiet, with most people hunkered down and waiting for the full storm to hit. U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi warplanes have been avoiding launching airstrikes in residential areas in a bid to reduce civilian casualties.

The jihadists also are continuing with preparations to defend the city center, blocking roads with mounds of dirt and erecting makeshift barriers. IS fighters bombed two buildings inside Mosul, Kurdish officials reported. On the battlefield, though, the taunts would seem to be misplaced.

Popular mobilization force The terror group has lost more than two dozen villages on the outskirts of Mosul since Iraqi security forces in the south and Kurdish peshmerga fighters in the east launched their long-awaited offensive Monday. The going has been quicker than Iraqi and U.S. commanders claimed they expected, and morale on the ground reportedly was remaining high. Even so, officials sought to tamp down expectations of a speedy defeat of the terror group as Iraqi and Kurdish forces contend with roadside bombs, snipers, suicide bombers, and hit-and-run attacks by the extremists. This U.N. map shows expected paths of escape from Mosul U.S. officials have stressed that the more than 100 embedded American forces will remain with Iraqi and peshmerga counterparts who are involved in coordinating and decision-making, rather than at the front lines of combat. But U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said U.S. troops are still in harm's way. Estimates of IS fighters in Mosul range from about 3,000 to 5,000. The fighting has remained on the outskirts of Mosul. The Kurdish peshmerga have been slowing or pausing their advance to allow units of the Iraqi security forces to leapfrog ahead of them. Iraqi officials say only ISF forces will enter the mainly Sunni Muslim city, but some Shi'ite popular mobilization force (PMF) members insist they, too, will enter the city center. Volesky stressed Wednesday that the U.S.-led coalition was not supporting the Shi'ite PMF. VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" The injuries were sustained earlier in the day in a Russian airstrike on Tell Rifaat, one town in a chain of northern Syrian settlements targeted by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The blistering week-long offensive has dimmed the rebels' hopes and transformed the battlefield in the north of the war-tortured country. Nearby on a gurney, an old man from the same town struggled for breath as he bled from grave leg and groin injuries. He and the three-year-old, transferred to a hospital inside Turkey, were among the few refugees admitted by Turkish border authorities. Syrian Aya Sharqawi, 6, wounded in an airstrike 10 days ago in her hometown of Tel Rifaat, Syria, lays on her bed at a hospital in Kilis, Turkey, Feb. 9, 2016. Struggling to cope The old man died hours later. Doctors and clinics in northern Syria are struggling to cope. The emergency medical charity said displaced people, including young children and the elderly, could be stuck living in the open in freezing conditions, with severe effects on their health. Pneumonia is a big concern. As the Assad government moves to press a choke-hold on Syrian rebels in Aleppo and the countryside beyond, backed by relentless airstrikes from Russian warplanes flying around-the-clock sorties, the numbers of civilian casualties are climbing rapidly across northern Syria. More are likely to die. Rebels fear that not only will opposition-areas in the city of Aleppo be cut off soon, but that Russian warplanes will expand their bombing runs to Idlib city, heralding a twin offensive aimed at interdicting supplies coming from Turkey through the border crossing west of Bab al-Salameh at Bab al-Hawa. FILE - Free Syrian Army fighters look at a Syrian Army jet, not pictured, in Fafeen village, north of Aleppo province, Syria. British officials estimate more than 1,380 civilians have been killed in Russian and Syrian government airstrikes since U.N.-brokered Geneva peace talks stalled last week. And bitterness is rising among Syrian rebel factions and civilians alike, with much of the anger not only directed at Damascus for the destruction it is wreaking but also at the West for what anti-Assad combatants and civilians alike see as Western passivity in the face of an offensive that has turned upside down the five-year-long uprising. By failing to act, the rebels say, the West is dooming the revolution to defeat. Idris still advises moderate rebel commanders on tactics. He says it is hard to get responses from U.S. military officials. FSA commanders have complained that since the start of the Assad offensive, they have been receiving fewer supplies than before. Idris says the weapons come through the Turkey-based Military Operations Center, which is staffed by Arab and Western intelligence personnel - including CIA officials - from 11 nations that support the FSA. A European diplomat disputes the claim by General Idris that the flow of weapons has been reduced, but says not all of the rebels' requests for specific weapons are being answered. FILE - U.N. mediator for Syria Staffan de Mistura (R) arrives for a news conference on the Syrian peace talks outside President Wilson hotel in Geneva, Switzerland Feb. 3, 2016. Push for political solution We will not fight the Russians, and you have to accept negotiations and you have to accept any solution that is put on the table. That is a widespread view among rebels and opposition activists. Rebel commanders, including Idris, contend the offensive indeed could be halted, if rebel factions were supplied with shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, thereby denying Assad control of the skies. Obama officials have long refused to supply so-called MANPADS and have urged Gulf allies to withhold them, too, fearing that some will be sold to jihadist groups like al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, much as there has been a steady stream of Western-supplied TOW anti-tank missiles sold to jihadists by FSA factions. FILE - Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters take position at a stronghold in Kobani, Syria. Pro-Assad Kurds That view is echoed by Zakaria Malahefji, the political officer of the 3,000-member Fastaqim Kama Umirt, a brigade aligned with the rebel alliance Jaish al-Mujahideen (Army of Holy Warriors). Malahefji says YPG commanders broke an agreement not to attack the strategically important air base at Menagh, six kilometers south of the border town of Azaz, close to Bab al-Salameh. The rebels seized Menagh from the Syrian government after a lengthy siege in August 2013. Kurds seize airfield YPG commanders contacted rebels holding the base Tuesday night and told them to withdraw, and Wednesday they took over the airfield, he added. YPG supporters have posted photographs of Kurdish fighters in combat at the base on social media sites. Malahefji claims the YPG received arms supplies from Damascus and Moscow months ago. In December, he says, a series of Syrian government and Russian helicopters flying in and out of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, near Menagh, were believed to be ferrying in weapons. Operations by YPG forces and their allies in northern Syria the past few days have complicated the defenses the FSA and Islamist militias have tried to mount. FILE - Syrian President Bashar Assad. Salih Muslim, the leader of the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, which dominates the YPG, has denied the rebels' claims in several interviews with VOA over the past three years, and he maintains no deal was struck with Damascus. A senior EU diplomat, though, told VOA Wednesday that he is no doubt that this week there has been close collaboration between the YPG and Damascus. Whatever the truth, rebels and opposition activists say YPG has also been fighting FSA and Islamist units around the Kurdish enclave of Afrin and on the northwestern outskirts of Aleppo. Earlier this week YPG fighters seized 460 tons of wheat intended for the Syrian Coalition from a silo at Alqamiya village, the activists say. YPG commanders in Afrin say their operations are of a humanitarian nature, and that by expanding their territory they are in fact blocking government forces from making further advances. In a bid to avoid being hit by Russian warplanes, locals in at least two villages invited the YPG to occupy them. YPG commanders issued a statement Wednesday saying they are ready to meet the call of all civilians who request that the YPG secure their villages.\",\n",

Days of clashes between moderate and Islamist rebel factions and the Islamic State group, which has mounted a fierce offensive on two key border towns, imperils rebel resupplies from Turkey. Kurdish spokesmen say they have opened closed roads to allow about 6,000 fleeing civilians into their border canton of Afrin.

FILE - Turkish artillery fire from the border toward northern Syria, in Kilis, Turkey, Feb. 16, 2016. Earlier this month under pressure from Moscow, the International Syria Support Group, the 20-power group that includes the U.S. and Russia, warned armed groups that they could be excluded from the cessation of hostilities agreement, which is only partially functioning, if they work with al Nusra or other factions deemed terrorists. Confusion on the ground With IS on the offensive in the northern Aleppo countryside that challenge will become greater. Rebel commanders say they have no choice but to work with al-Nusra on occasion when they are being hard-pressed by IS or the Assad regime, which they argue is doing all it can to push factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad into the arms of al-Nusra in order to paint them as terrorist in nature. Activists say that since March al-Nusra has been gaining on average 200 to 300 new recruits a month. Over the weekend the al-Qaida affiliate said it was mobilizing to support rebel factions battling to retain control of the strategically-vital border towns of Azaz and Marea, the onetime HQ of the FSA in Aleppo province. Internally displaced Syrians line up to receive blankets near the Bab al-Salam crossing, across from Turkey's Kilis province, on the outskirts of the northern border town of Azaz, Syria, Feb. 6, 2016. Kurdish propagandists claim Nusra fighters are already engaged in the battle but this is denied by FSA commanders. The Syrian towns of Azaz and Marea, near the Turkey border Marea and Azaz fell to opposition forces in 2012 and are vital stops along a rebel supply route from Turkey to districts the rebels hold in Aleppo, which the government has been trying to encircle for months. The pro-opposition monitoring group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground for its information, said the fighting in the area is the heaviest in months and that the offensive amounts to the most significant advance near the Turkish border for IS in two years. Humanitarian situation The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, evacuated most of its staff and patients from al-Salamah hospital near Azaz on Friday.

In Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, politicians say they could get no access to the Trump campaign to try to work out what his thoughts are on Kurdistan independence or how the war against the Islamic State terror group would change. FILE - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters take part during a training session by coalition forces in a training camp in Irbil, north of Iraq, March 9, 2016. Figuring out Trump There is a guessing game going on in Iraq about the meaning of Trump. An Israeli man holds a sign of U.S. presidential candidate Republican Donald Trump as he watches a live update with friends of the U.S. presidential election results at Mike's place bar in Jerusalem, Wednesday Nov. 9, 2016. But in March he said that as president he would move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something that would delight Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. More recently top Trump aides told The Times of Israel he doesn't see a two-state solution as a priority and he would pursue warmer relations with Tel Aviv, following eight difficult years in U.S.-Israel relations under President Barack Obama. FILE - Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walks with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton upon her arrival to their meeting in Jerusalem, Nov. 20, 2012. But his inconsistent campaign speeches and off-the-cuff remarks have prompted nervous head-scratching and bewilderment. Hillary Clinton was a known figure.

FILE - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif speaks during a press conference with his Danish counterpart Kristian Jensen after their talks in Tehran, Iran, Monday, Jan. 4, 2016. Ankara offers congratulations All governments in the region were quick Wednesday to congratulate President-elect Trump and to start maneuvering quickly to get access to advisers around him. Ankara was among the first to offer congratulations. It took the opportunity to press for the extradition of the U.S.-based exiled cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who it accuses of masterminding the failed coup attempt of July 15. Syrian rebels who have been battling to oust President Bashar al-Assad for nearly six years, appear among the most anxious about what a Trump presidency might entail.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Americans Advancing on Mosul with Iraqis and Kurds More than 100 American troops are accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish peshmerga forces in their push to take back the city of Mosul from Islamic State forces. Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters Tuesday the Americans are assisting about 10,000 Kurds, 18,000 Iraqi Security Forces and another couple thousand Iraqi police as they face an Islamic State force that has been hunkered down in the second-largest Iraqi city for more than two years. Estimates of IS fighters in Mosul range from about 3,000 to 5,000 fighters, but U.S. officials say Mosul is home to greater skilled IS fighters who are more dedicated to the fight and more ideologically zealous. Davis said the more than 100 U.S. forces are embedded with Iraqi Security Forces at the division headquarters level. They also are embedded with Kurdish and Iraqi counterterrorism commandos at levels considered below the division level. U.S. officials have stressed that embedded American forces will remain with Iraqi and peshmerga counterparts who are involved in coordinating and decision making, rather than at the frontlines of combat. But U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said U.S. troops are still in harm's way. Iraqi and Kurdish forces say they have retaken a dozen villages outside Mosul, and Davis said there are four major points from which the offensive is pushing into the city. Kurdish peshmerga units are advancing on Kurdish villages from two points east of Mosul, with Iraqi Security Forces following behind. ISF forces are advancing from the north from the Qayarrah West base, and another ISF team is pushing into Mosul from the southeast. Much of the west is still controlled by Islamic State, prompting U.S. officials to suggest that the IS leadership may look to flee west to Raqqah should Mosul start to fall. These officials say they have so far seen some IS family members flee west, but they have not seen foreign fighters coming in or out of the city recently. The long-awaited offensive, backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition and involving Sunni tribal forces and Shiite militias, remains on the outskirts of Mosul. Peshmerga forces advance in the east of Mosul to attack Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq, Oct. 18, 2016. IS fighters have burned tires and oil to obscure their movements, but officials say the tactic hasn't degraded air support by the coalition, which carried out four strikes against IS forces in and around Mosul on Monday. East of Mosul, the Kurdish peshmerga forces advanced quickly, with U.S. officials saying Tuesday that the Kurds had seen less resistance than anticipated. Iraqi armed forces to the city's south have been making slower progress because they have more ground to cover, having begun their operations 40 kilometers from the edge of Mosul. On the first day of the offensive, Iraqi regulars along with Shiite militiamen overran three villages. Their target Tuesday is the village of Zawiya. This U.N. map shows expected paths of escape from Mosul Iraqi officials say there will be no sustained airstrikes on the city center to avoid high casualties among the more than 1 million civilians still in the city. This is the largest and most complex military operation in Iraq since U.S. combat forces left the country five years ago. It will involve Iraqi-led troops, Kurdish peshmerga, Iraqi police, and Sunni and Shiite militias. However, it is raising concerns about the safety of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the area, and aid agencies are warning of a likely humanitarian crisis. While they can't stop the advances, they can slow them. Movement forward by all coalition forces is methodical, with commanders opting for caution as they come under mortar and sniper fire. On the southern front, Iraqi troops are moving painstakingly into the village of Abbas, which is larger than most of its neighbors. Pockets of IS militants have been mounting lightning attacks. Iraqi troops are also fearful of improvised bombs, which have been planted in the main thoroughfares. Peshmerga forces advance in the east of Mosul to attack Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq, Oct. 18, 2016. In the east, there were conflicting reports about why some Kurdish peshmerga appeared to have paused their advance Tuesday. Some Kurdish commanders said they had done so to allow Iraqi forces, who are earmarked to enter the city, to move forward. Others said they were in the process of re-ordering their own units. Spokesman Davis said that pauses would need to occur throughout the fight so that anti-IS forces could conduct clearing operations or wait for logistics. The peshmerga forces paused moving forward because we coordinate with the Iraqi military. We have achieved our goal in the first day. Now the Iraqi army will take it from there. There have been several reports of IS suicide bombers driving cars packed with explosives at their foes. Soon after the peshmerga offensive began early Monday with Kurdish troops moving over dirt mounds marking the frontline between them and IS fighters on the eastern or Khazir front, IS offered stiff resistance, trying to strike back with mortar fire and car bombs. Two cars driving at the Peshmerga were destroyed by airstrikes, but another managed to get close to the Kurds before being detonated, according to commanders. Long fight expected U.S. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the coalition's ground commander in Iraq, tamped down expectations of a quick victory at Mosul. Smoke rises from Islamic state positions after an airstrike by coalition forces in Mosul, Iraq, Oct. 18, 2016. The peshmerga Chief of General Staff, Jamal Iminiki, also cautioned reporters not to expect a rapid collapse of IS resistance. IS militants have had plenty of time to prepare for the fight and have constructed elaborate defenses, including a network of tunnels, in the city. Monday and Tuesday, Iraqi planes continued to drop leaflets warning civilians in Mosul and outlying villages of the offensive, urging them to stay indoors and to avoid any IS positions, which may prove difficult, with IS fighters throughout the city. The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs called on all participating forces to ensure the safety of civilians in Mosul, and Iraqi commanders say they are taking steps to help civilians escape.

       " {'content': \" In Disguise, VOA Team Ventures Into IS Stronghold News from the area was spotty at best. No one was sure who the militants were. Afghans? Foreigners? Disgruntled Taliban? Where did they come from? What were they up to? What was the situation on the ground? Locals seemed to be scared and fleeing. Officials were hesitant to admit the extent of the problem. A VOA colleague and I decided to check things out for ourselves. With me were cameraman Rahim Gul Sarwan and a local fixer, whose identity I will not reveal for security reasons. Complex planning We had plans, then back-up plans, then back-ups for the back-up plans, knowing full well that most of those plans could fall apart at any time. Boys observe as VOA cameraman Rahim Gul Sarwan prepares to shoot video in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan. IS was not our only problem. Kidnappings for ransom are a major concern. If you look like someone who has money, you are a target. If you look like a foreigner, you are a bigger target. Other hazards, like roadside bombs and suicide attacks, are more random and harder to mitigate. But this is Afghanistan. You can get hit by shrapnel on your way to a cafe, so you learn to cope with the fear. We decided on a beat-up Toyota Corolla, a staple in Afghanistan, as our transportation. No one would take a second look at it. Then we needed another vehicle: the right cover story, with fake IDs to match. Word of a visiting foreign journalist could spread quickly, perhaps to an IS spy or criminals looking for targets. My South Asian looks helped. If I wore local clothing and kept my mouth shut, I could pass as Afghan. I put on an abaya, or long black robe, and kept my face covered most of the time with a hijab or a black scarf. Only my eyes were visible. With my Afghan cameraman and fixer, we could pass as a local family. Jalabad as a proving ground We picked a low-profile hotel, not a place where foreigners or the wealthy stay, and asked for rooms on the second floor. That would give us time to respond in case of an attack, but keep us close enough to the ground to be able to jump and run if we had to. Jalalabad is much more conservative than the country's capital, Kabul. We finished all indoor shooting first and planned street shots that could be finished in less than 10 minutes, and then left for Kabul right away. Throughout the drive, we watched our rearview mirror to make sure no one was following. VOA reporter Ayesha Tanzeem, right, meets with a Shinwari tribal elder in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. On to Achin But the trip to Achin proved even more nerve-racking. IS militants have established safehavens in the district, from which they plan and mount attacks on surrounding areas, capturing and beheading hundreds of locals. They probably had spies among the population. Our plan was to be invisible as we approached. Be local. Be part of the landscape. That included managing my bodily needs. Once we left our Jalalabad hotel, using the toilet was not an option. Public toilets for women are rare in Afghanistan anyway. In a mostly rural area like Achin, they would be difficult to find. So I drank as much as possible the night before and relied on chewing gum to quench my thirst for most of the day, until we could reach safety. We also knew that the moment we took out our camera or started talking to locals about IS in Achin, our cloak of invisibility would be gone, so we needed protection there and on the way back. More security measures Sarwan, who has become somewhat of a security expert himself after traveling and reporting from so many dangerous areas, knew the district governor, Haji Ghalib. A former mujahid who had fought the Russians and then the Taliban, Ghalib had become a bit of a local media celebrity for his bravery in taking on IS militants. He would provide us security in Achin and escort us back to the highway. We got more security than we had expected. Zabiullah Zmaray, a Nangarhar provincial council member whom we had interviewed, also agreed to accompany us to the district. He was another of the few local leaders who spoke up against IS in public, making him a target. He was not going to take any chances, either with his life or mine. So, when we set out for Achin, we found two armored cars and dozens of men in bulletproof vests and fully loaded AK-47s waiting for us. On the road, we were joined by Afghan National Army troops, men in armored Humvees with rocket-propelled grenades. Had I just been elected president of the country? This was the most impressive VIP treatment I had ever received. But the entourage meant that our VOA team no longer was invisible. I quietly patted my pockets for items I might need if I had to make a run for it: tracker, backup phone, emergency numbers; local currency. In case of an ambush, he would be a phone call away. An Afghan National Army soldier and VOA reporter Ayesha Tanzeem, left, wait at a police checkpoint barrier in Achin, a district in eastern Afghanistan. Dangerous road Achin is a dusty place. The main road into the district leads through areas that have witnessed fighting between IS and Taliban. The driver told me that one bazaar on the way was considered particularly dangerous because militants sometimes throw grenades at moving cars. By this time, we had left the armored cars behind and I was in an armored Humvee, clad in an abaya topped by a bulletproof vest. As soon as we got out of the Humvee, we were told to duck and run behind the checkpoint barriers. Apparently, IS had long-range sniper rifles they had used to kill soldiers at that post. In the end, we got multiple stories and lived to tell them. Would I take the risk again? In a heartbeat.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Turkey Shells US-Allied Kurds in Northern Syria Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu confirmed the overnight Saturday artillery barrage and demanded the YPG withdraw from the Syrian border town of Azaz and vacate a nearby air base the Kurds seized last week from Syrian rebel forces. The Turkish shelling continued Sunday. Operations by YPG forces and their allies in northern Syria the past few days have complicated the defenses of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) and Islamist militias. Syrian rebels accuse the YPG of coordinating with the Assad government and acting as a spoiler tactically. FILE - Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters take up positions inside a damaged building in al-Vilat al-Homor neighborhood in Hasaka city, Syria. Rebel commanders say YPG fighters are now in parts of Azaz just six kilometers from the border with Turkey. Turkey considers both the PYD and PKK as terrorist groups. Despite continued Turkish shelling Sunday the YPG claimed to have captured the village of Ayn Daqnah, east of Menagh and south of Azaz. Effective US partner Rebel commanders accuse the YPG, which has been the most effective partner with the U.S. on the ground in the struggle against Islamic State in Syria, of assisting a government assault on the nearby and strategically important town of Tell Rifaat, where on Saturday women started to arm themselves to form a loosely coordinated battalion. According to Turkish military officials, the shelling of YPG positions came in retaliation for Kurdish gunfire and was focused just southwest of Azaz. Rami Abdel Rahman, of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said Turkish shelling struck wider afield, targeting YPG positions near the Menagh, an air base the Kurds took from Syrian rebels.

Turkish officials also confirmed that on Saturday Turkish soldiers shelled Syrian regime forces near the Çalıboğazı border post in the province of Hatay. Again they say this was in retaliation for gunfire directed at them. Turkey, Saudi Arabia discuss ground force But in an interview Saturday with German newspaper Handelsblatt Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir focused his comments on Russia's military intervention, saying it would not help Assad remain in power, suggesting both Ankara and Riyadh may be contemplating military action against Assad, widening a war dangerously and raising the prospect of a Turkish clash with the Russians.

But he did confirm Saudi Arabia would be sending an undisclosed number of warplanes to the NATO air base at Incirlik in Adana near the Syrian border in southern Turkey. Turkish media are reporting that eight to10 Saudi jets will be deployed at Incirlik within the coming weeks. Four F-16 fighters are expected to arrive in a first wave. Seeking wider intervention Davutoglu expressed frustration with the ongoing UN-brokered peace negotiations in Munich, casting doubt on the hopes for a cessation of hostilities that is meant to begin in days.

       " {'content': \" French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Trogneux, wave to former President Francois Hollande as he leaves after the handover ceremony at the Elysee Palace in Paris, May 14, 2017. Macron was greeted midmorning at the Élysée Palace by outgoing President Francois Hollande, who for many of the French exemplifies more than most of his predecessors the old saying that all political careers end in failure. Outgoing French President Francois Hollande, center left, welcomes incoming French President Emmanuel Macron as he arrives for his inauguration ceremony at the Elysee palace in Paris, May 14, 2017. Macron has the reputation, reinforced by his election, as a man who always succeeds. Just before Macron's arrival, Hollande stood on his office balcony taking one last sweeping glance from it of the palace grounds. Amid the pomp and circumstance Sunday, future challenges were half-forgotten by the crowds lining the Champs-Élysées, where at the Arc de Triomph, Macron lay flowers at the memorial to the unknown soldier Inside the Élysée's ballroom earlier, Macron was presented with the grand collier de la Légion d'honneur once owned by Napoleon I. President Emmanuel Macron light up the flame on the Unknown Soldier's tomb at the Arc of Triomphe after his formal inauguration ceremony as French President in Paris, May 14, 2017. The world, and Europe, need France more than ever, he added. Unifying France will be a tall order. Twenty-one million people voted for Macron in the second round of the elections, but 12 million backed far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, despite her lackluster campaign. And four million destroyed their ballot papers as a sign of disapproval of both candidates, the largest number ever to do so in a French election. Children walk past election campaign posters for French centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, in Osses, southwestern France, May 5, 2017. France is voting Sunday in the second round of the presidential elec Having set himself the monumental tasks of trying to expand the center, and of convincing half the country which disapproves of EU membership that the European bloc is something to be valued, Macron has the immediate challenge of securing a parliamentary majority to back him. He can do that either by leading his one-year-old En Marche! Polls suggest he might be able to pull off a parliamentary victory, one as unthinkable as his presidential win, and secure, a majority in the 577-seat lower house. Much will depend on who he names Monday as his initial prime minister. President-elect Emmanuel Macron is seen on a giant screen near the Louvre museum after results were announced in the second round of voting in the 2017 French presidential elections, in Paris, France, May 7, 2017. If his party fails to win the majority of seats, the alternative would be La Cohabitation with a prime minister from an opposing political party, something the Fifth Republic has seen three times since 1958. Macron wants to cut public spending and reorder a rigid labor market to allow businesses to hire and fire more easily, all in a bid to revive a stagnant economy. At the same he says he wants to ameliorate the downsides of globalization for those left behind. Meeting with Merkel He has been courting assiduously German leaders the past two years. He intends to push for closer cooperation between EU members as well greater centralization of the countries in the eurozone with the creation of a budget. Macron has talked tough about Britain when it comes to Brexit, but his approach will likely be shaped by Pisani-Ferry.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" EU: 100,000 Places for Migrants in Reception Centers Thousands of mostly Middle Eastern migrants fleeing war and poverty continued pushing Monday through the Balkans toward Western Europe, as European Union leaders struggled to avert a looming humanitarian disaster with winter fast approaching. As cold weather continues to set in on much of the continent, EU leaders met Sunday for a fifth time to address the crisis. The grouping agreed to expand reception centers in Greece to accommodate 100,000 more migrants, while failing to bridge political differences dividing the continent between those governments willing to help address the crisis and those so far refusing to provide long-term shelter. EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker said more reception centers will be constructed along the so-called Balkan route traveled by most migrants from war-torn Syria in recent weeks. The new structures will house 50,000 people, while additional facilities are planned in Greece for 50,000 more migrants. From left, European Parliament President Martin Schulz, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras chat after a meeting about the Balkan refugee crisis with leaders from central and eastern Europe, Oct. 25, 2015. Juncker, who released nearly 20 aid proposals Monday, described the reception units as vital for registering migrants and managing their travels. But he also voiced dismay that previous vows of help from EU countries have not yet been acted upon. The mini gathering of central and eastern European leaders Sunday was sought by Chancellor Merkel, who has voiced concern for migrants as winter sets in. The meeting was the latest in a series of top-level EU meetings to find a unified approach on how to best deal with the thousands of migrants streaming into the EU every day. Police said the country has seen nearly 250,000 enter the country since then. Migrants turned to Croatia after Hungary erected a barbed-wire fence along its border with Serbia. Countries called to meet The leaders of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, attended the Brussels summit. But some EU lawmakers complained ahead of the meeting that all 28 EU member countries should attend and that France's absence in particular threatened progress on a plan. A man comforts a woman upon arrival with other refugees and migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos on October 25, 2015 after they crossed the Aegean sea from Turkey. More than 680,000 migrants and refugees have crossed to Europe by sea so far this year, fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, according to the International Organization for Migration. Some criticism Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania said they would close their borders if Germany or other countries shut the door on refugees. A group of migrants walks toward Austria from a camp in Sentilj, Slovenia, Oct. 25, 2015. At the Brezice camp in Slovenia near the border with Croatia, U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) spokesman Babar Baloch urged leaders to come up with a system to register and screen newcomers when they first enter Europe, rather than piecemeal along the way. The lack of a common policy is straining ties among European leaders, raising questions about the EU's future. Rights group Amnesty International said the 28-counry bloc could not afford to end another meeting without an agreed plan. Death toll The continent is experiencing the worst migration crisis since World War Two. Around a dozen others, mostly Afghans, are still missing after the rickety vessel, carrying 60 people, went down at dawn as it made the perilous crossing from Turkey, according to the Greek coast guard. Also Sunday, the bodies of 40 people thought to be migrants were discovered on beaches near a city 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Tripoli, the Red Crescent said. Syrian refugees lie exhausted moments after arriving by a raft at a beach on the Greek island of Lesbos, Oct. 25, 2015. Misrati did not give any further details about the nationality of the deceased, but the Tripoli authorities' official news agency reported that they were from Africa.

IS is now surrounded in a few square kilometers, but they have as many as 100,000 people trapped inside with them. Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi says Islamic State militants in Mosul will be defeated in the coming days, June 24, 2017. In the ruins of the Old City, Ahmed doused his head in water and the smell of rotting corpses wafted out of a church across a narrow street. Soldiers pried open a broken metal door and the stench was overwhelming. IS militants must have used the church as some kind of base, with a food schedule posted and their logo spray painted on the wall. Bodies of militants lay crushed among the rubble. Bodies of IS militants litter the streets and buildings in the areas of Old Mosul recently captured, while the bodies of families are buried in the rubble, June 25, 2017. Inside his make shift base, a former factory, at least four IS corpses are rotting. Soldiers covered the bodies in debris to mask the smell, but they are in no rush to bury the bodies of their enemies. Bitter victory approaches Militant snipers fire on the Iraqi point overlooking the mosque and grenades launched with machine guns lob overhead and into Iraqi-controlled territory. The destroyed Al-Hadba minaret at Grand al-Nuri Mosque is shown in Mosul, Iraq, June 22, 2017. Capturing the 900-year-old mosque was supposed to be a victory day after more than eight months of fighting for Mosul. Politicians promised an Iraqi flag waving from the mosque. Soldiers dreamed of the day they would march into the mosque in a long-awaited win. Now the mosque, like the rest of the neighborhood is in ruins and the minaret juts into the sky like an amputee. Dozens of other ancient mosques, churches, statutes and other ancient treasures have also been destroyed in Mosul. Live bodies The body of a man buried in this Old Mosul garden after he was shot dead by IS for smoking, June 25, 2017. On a hard mat in a sweltering refugee camp, Qassam and his family describe their desperate flight after an airstrike collapsed their house, killing his brother and his child. By some estimates there are only a few hundred militants still fighting, but military officials say the massive civilian population believed to be crowded in the homes prevents them from flattening the area. Families flee Old Mosul as soon as Iraqi forces are close enough to protect them, June 25, 2017. But Hassan, 12, and nine-year-old Abdullah kept running.',\n",

Friday's actions came as a result of what U.S. officials described as an ongoing process that included consultations with key U.S. agencies and also U.S. allies. The new sanctions are a culmination of the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive stance with Tehran, following a presidential campaign in which then-candidate Donald Trump said he was willing to rip up the nuclear deal former President Barack Obama and other world leaders negotiated with Iran.

The meaning or the impact of the promised Iranian sanctions was not immediately clear. New U.S. sanctions But senior administration officials in Washington said the new U.S. sanctions would have some bite. Whether those involved the acquisition of U.S.-made, dual-use materials or interactions with the U.S. financial system, the Iranian efforts will be impacted, the official added. U.S. officials also said the sanctions did not impact U.S. compliance with the Iran nuclear deal and that none of the individuals or entities had previously been sanctioned under the Obama administration. Some analysts, however, are doubtful the sanctions will amount to anything more than messaging. And while much of the attention has focused on Iran's ballistic missile program, Trump administration officials have voiced significant concerns about Iran's use of proxy forces across the Middle East, and in Yemen in particular.

Already, the U.S. appears to be backing up the concerns with action, sending the destroyer USS Cole to conduct patrols off the coast of Yemen with an eye on freedom of navigation in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. But whether with the ballistic missile tests or with operations in the waters off Yemen, it may take some time before Tehran is ready to change its overall approach.

Tony Shaffer, a retired intelligence officer now with the London Center for Policy Research, expects Iran will learn quickly that the Trump administration is unlikely to have nearly as much patience as its predecessor. Also yet to be seen is what the new dynamic between Washington and Tehran will mean for Iran's proxies in both Iraq and Syria. Analysts and others say, so far, the activity and rhetoric of the Iranian-backed militias has remained fairly consistent, with little change from the emboldened approach they began taking last year. Much of that has involved Iranian propaganda talking up the militias' role in beating back the Islamic State terror group.

       " {'content': \" UN: Greece Must Lead on Refugee Crisis To underscore the deadly risks migrants are taking to reach Europe, six Syrian migrants, including an infant, drowned off the Turkish coast Tuesday as they tried to reach the Greek island of Kos. The UNHCR on Tuesday said the Greek government has a responsibility to do more, and the European Union must also support Athens. Locals overwhelmed Last month alone, more than 50,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Greece - twice as many as arrived during all of last year, the UNHCR said. FILE - A policeman hits a migrant as police try to disperse hundreds of migrants during a registration procedure that was taking place at the stadium of Kos town, on the southeastern island of Kos, Greece, Aug. 11, 2015. They are overworked. In some cases they have not received even the most basic assistance. They are frustrated. Rising tensions led to clashes last week on the Greek island of Kos, between local police and desperate migrants and refugees, many fleeing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. In response, Greece chartered a passenger ship, which will be used to house and process hundreds of Syrian refugees, many of whom are living in tents or cardboard boxes. Spindler told VOA the rising tensions are aggravated by a lack of communication between the new arrivals and police. To try to remedy this, he said the UNHCR has sent to the islands a number of interpreters who can speak Arabic, Farsi and other languages. Europe's help Spindler said Greece needs to show more leadership on the migration issue, but he added that most of the refugees and migrants end up in other European countries, so Europe cannot sit back and do nothing. People arrive thinking they are in the European Union. A migrant child sits aboard a dinghy with others as they try to start their journey from the coastal town of Bodrum, Turkey, to the nearby Greek island of Kos, Aug. 18, 2015. So far this year, nearly 250,000 migrants have reached Europe by sea, compared with 219,000 for all of 2014, and at least 2,349 have died making the journey, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Tuesday. A total of 1,000 migrants are being rescued on their way to Italy and Greece each day, IOM spokesman Joel Millman said. Aid kits On Tuesday, the German Red Cross said it will distribute hygiene kits to migrants to try to prevent disease from spreading as they arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos. The aid organization said that starting in mid-September it will hand out more than 19,000 kits, each containing a two-month supply of toothpaste, soap, laundry detergent, baby-care products and diapers. Germany also is expecting 750,000 people to seek asylum this year, up from a previous estimate of 450,000, government sources told the business daily Handelsblatt. Children migrants walk along railway tracks while police officers try to secure the entrance of the railway station in the southern Macedonian town of Gevgelija, as migrants prepare to board a train toward Serbia, Aug. 17, 2015. Germany is the biggest recipient of asylum-seekers in the European Union, and some cities are saying they already cannot cope with the influx, as hostility toward and attacks on migrants has surged in some areas. The issue of asylum-seekers has also forced Chancellor Angela Merkel to address fears among some voters that migrants will eat up taxpayers' money and take their jobs. Border protection Hungary, which has registered 100,000 migrants so far this year, compared with 43,000 in all of 2014, said on Tuesday it will send thousands of policemen to its southern border with Serbia, where it is building a 177-kilometer (110-mile) security fence, to stem the influx of refugees. Landlocked Hungary is part of the European Union's Schengen zone of passport-free travel, making it attractive to migrants transiting the non-EU Balkans. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff, Janos Lazar, said the deployment of additional border guards was required because of what he called the increasingly aggressive and resolute behavior of migrants, many of whom are arriving from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. The European Union, which is struggling with how to handle the influx of migrants, failed to agree last month on how to spread 40,000 asylum-seekers among its members. FILE - A refugee walks near tents at the refugee camp in Traiskirchen, Austria, July 31, 2015. Patzelt said the conditions represent a failure to care for refugees fleeing wars, and violate U.N conventions. A team from the rights watchdog visited the Traiskirchen center, south of Vienna, Aug. 6 and found migrants seeking out shady areas of the center's grounds to escape from relentless heat. They also said four doctors and three psychologists, working only a few hours a day, are responsible for the care of the more than 4,000 people at the center. Legislation considered In response to the criticism, the Austrian parliament Monday considered legislation that would force towns that balk at taking in refugees to accept them. The draft law, which could become law by October, obliges towns to allow refugees numbering up to 1.5 percent of the local population onto federally designated sites if their province does not fulfill agreed upon quotas. Elsewhere, Italian police arrested eight suspected human traffickers on suspicion of homicide Tuesday. The eight suspects are accused of possibly forcing migrants to stay in the hold of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean as 49 of them suffocated on engine fumes. The dead migrants were discovered last weekend aboard an overcrowded fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea north of Libya. Monday, the Italian coast guard delivered the bodies, as well as 320 survivors from the boat, to Catania, Italy, where officials say they will bury the dead migrants in a local cemetery.

       " {'content': \" Shifting Allegiances, A Free-for-All in Northern Syria Syrian rebel commander Abu Ali Sijjo has for months fought Islamic State, liberating a village along the border from the terror group, while at the same time battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. But as mainly moderate and Islamic nationalist rebel militias -- some backed by the U.S. -- are faced with an unrelenting Assad ground offensive, pulverizing round-the-clock Russian airstrikes and Kurdish attacks in northern Syria, even this rebel commander is questioning where his future allegiances may lie. Most rebel fighters and commanders are debating with themselves and each other about what they should do, how they should re-group and who they should align with in defense of what is left of the dwindling territory they are clinging onto in the Aleppo countryside. Are The Syrian Rebels United? The Syrian revolution has been marked by the fractiousness of its armed groups and political factions. In the face of impeding doom, deep divisions and disagreements remain. The former chief of staff of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA), General Salem Idris, recently expressed his frustration to VOA about the bickering that erupted during an emergency meeting between militia commanders in the northern Aleppo countryside. Over the past five years many attempts have been made to achieve some unity of purpose and alliances have come and gone with dizzying speed. On Monday, eight prominent Aleppo rebel groups agreed to unite for operational purposes under the tactical leadership of Hashim al Sheikh, a former member and ally of Ahrar al-Sham, the hard-line Islamist militia which is aligned with al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. Although this is not a full merger with Ahrar al-Sham, it will strengthen the Islamist group, and will likely better position it to absorb later other militias, fear analysts. FILE - Syrian rebels attend a training session in Maaret Ikhwan near Idlib, Syria. And that has been the constant refrain of Moscow. Since the Assad offensive started more than a week ago, that line has been echoed by the leaders of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). A rebel realignment that appears to be emerging that strengthens Salafi-Jihadist and hardline Islamist groups will be a self-fulfilling prophecy, argue many Syria watchers. They say Moscow has been pursing a strategy it used in Chechnya: target the moderates and crush them, which in turn leaves only extremists remaining, allowing the regime to force people and foreign governments to choose between either the regime or the extremists with no moderate alternative. With the noose tightening around the city of Aleppo and militias on the back foot in the countryside to the north of the city, many rebel fighters will have no option but to join the bigger more powerful groups like Ahrar al-Sham or al Nusra or align with them, says Bassam al Kuwaiti, a well known figure in pro-opposition civil society circles. FILE - Young Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fighter who recently volunteered holds a position with his weapon in Kobani, Syria. Where do the Kurds come into this? The YPG dominates the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces. Some Sunni Arab and Turkmen militias are also members of the SDF but several have checkered histories and have formed opportunistic alliances in the past with rebel militias they are now fighting. Some have even worked with jihadists in the past. Some fighters are from Western-backed militias such as the Hazzm Movement and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, which collapsed last year after being attacked by by Islamist militias and al-Nusra. The SDF, which was unveiled in October, was embraced by U.S. officials as a proxy army to partner with in northern Syria to fight Islamic State and was seen by Washington as an alternative to a ground force the Obama administration had hoped to recruit from scratch and train and equip. Until the Assad offensive, the Kurdish-dominated SDF focused on fighting IS to the east of the Euphrates River and received arms supplies from the U.S. to do so. There were signs SDF fighters would move into the Aleppo countryside. PYD leaders have made little secret they want to unite Kurdish cantons along the border. But they have quickly expanded, exploiting the Assad offensive and Russian airstrikes, which noticeably have not been targeting them, to seize more towns and territory, including a major airbase that has been in rebel hands since August 2013. This week they occupied the strategic town of Tell Rifaat, just 15 kilometers form the border with Turkey. They contend they have sheltered Arab Sunni families who have fled heavy fighting in the Kurdish enclave of Afrin and by taking towns are ensuring they are denied to the regime. Syrian rebel commanders, however, insist there has been clear military coordination, and say they will never forgive what they consider treachery by the Kurds. The Obama administration has urged the Kurds to restrain themselves but the rebels say that if Washington really wanted the YPG to stop it could exert more pressure. FILE - Free Syrian Army rebels hold a revolutionary flag during a demonstration in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria. Where does this Leave the US ? The realignments and shifts will impact U.S. strategy in Syria, say analysts. The Obama administration has made the defeat of the Islamic State its top priority in Syria and has argued only a political solution and not a military one can resolve the five-year-long civil war that has left upwards of 250,000 people dead. But some analysts warn that even the U.S. objective of defeating IS will be undermined by the events of the past week. Rebel commanders say that the U.S. will find fewer militias trusting it in the future. FILE - Syrian President Bashar Assad. What is Turkey doing? The two are connected, they say, and extremists will thrive in the chaos of the civil war. Last autumn, it looked as if Washington would agree to this in return for the use of a NATO airbase in Turkey for coalition warplanes striking at IS. But after weeks of talks Washington decided against establishing a safe haven. Turkish and Gulf allies such as Saudi Arabia have been lobbying for a ground force to intervene in Syria but in recent days they have made it clear that such a force would have to be agreed by the coalition and there are no signs of Western appetite for such an intervention. The Turks have warned also they will not tolerate the Kurds expanding their territory in the Aleppo countryside and are continuing to shell YPG positions.\",\n",

       " {'content': ' US Needs Broad Coalition to Fight IS Militants, Analysts Say With President Barack Obama setting a new strategy to combat Islamic State militants (also known as ISIL or ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, analysts say he will need to build a broad-based coalition of international and regional players to support those efforts. Bilal Y. Saab That, he said, will require fixing the broken political systems in Iraq and Syria and providing opportunities for disenfranchised youth. In the interim, he believes the U.S. should continue airstrikes to disrupt IS and keep it on the run. Avoiding past mistakes But analysts caution the U.S. against taking too active a role in what will be a lengthy and bloody conflict. He points to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that gave birth to al-Qaida. Rami G. Khouri Groups like al-Qaida and IS, he said, see themselves as trying to protect Muslims from both corrupt dictators and foreign aggressors. Regional response The U.S. coalition so far consists of 10 members: The U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Italy and Turkey. The State Department says as many as 40 countries have contributed to U.S. efforts in Iraq in the form of humanitarian aid and donation of arms. Islamic State areas of control, Sept. 10, 2014 Secretary of State John Kerry is in the region this week to drum up broader regional support. The way Khouri sees it, three groups should take the leading role in fighting IS. Kurdish Peshmerga forces have been fighting Islamist militants in northern Iraq since June, and Sunni forces have been on the offense since at least mid-August. For the first time last weekend, they took part in a ground operation alongside Iraqi forces, securing a dam that IS militants had been trying to take for weeks. But many now say they are willing to turn against IS if they are given a voice in the new government of Haider Al-Abadi, who was confirmed this week as prime minister. But in Syria, any U.S. effort against Sunni militants is liable to be seen as helpful to President Bashar Al-Assad. Daniel Benjamin Gulf outreach The Arab League Monday called for taking drastic action against extremists like IS, but stopped short of expressing support for the U.S. effort. Saudi Arabia announced it will host talks in Jeddah this week with officials from Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and other members of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. The United Arab Emirates released a statement last week expressing support for regional and international efforts against terrorism, not just in Iraq and Syria, but wherever it is found. Gulf countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have been criticized for their support Sunni rebels against Bashar Al-Assad and for turning a blind eye to the flow of funds from wealthy donors to IS. But this has changed, she said, particularly in recent months. Faysal Itani',\n",

In a call Thursday with groups affiliated with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning Washington think-tank, Obama said activists who want peace must not make the same mistake they did in the run-up to the Iraq war, when proponents of the war drowned out their weaker voices. FILE - U.S. President Barack Obama takes a question during a news conference about the recent nuclear deal reached with Iran, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, July 15, 2015. The president, who has been aggressively courting Democrats, said legislators he's talked to say they want to vote for the deal, but cite the vigorous and loudly heard opposition, which has been beating a drumbeat against the agreement in virtually every social forum in the United States. The July 14 agreement, reached between Iran and the U.S. plus five other world powers, calls on Tehran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. However, opposition in the United States has been unexpectedly strong, with opponents of the deal questioning whether it goes far enough to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. Iraq War comparison Obama said that many of the opponents are the same people who pushed the United States into war in Iraq in 2003. Obama suggested the United States could be forced into a military confrontation with Iran within six months of backing out of the deal. Activists deliver more than 400,000 petition signatures to Capitol Hill in support of the Iran nuclear deal in Washington, July 29, 2015. Obama explained how the deal is designed to prevent Iran from acquiring the nuclear weapons he said it otherwise could develop within six months without the deal's constraints. Not only are the vast majority of Republicans in Congress opposed and mobilizing to send him a resolution of disapproval in September, but support among Democrats has been slow to come. Democratic support Four Democrats voiced their support for the deal for the first time Thursday, including Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a party leader in the House, and Michigan's Dan Kildee, who counts Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine who is being held in Iran on espionage charges, as a constituent. New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall and North Carolina Representative David Price also announced their support for the agreement, a boost for Obama amid a week of furious lobbying and committee hearings on Capitol Hill.

Pro-Israel lobby The White House did not provide a list of all the groups on Thursday's call.

       " {'content': \" Iran Escalates Involvement in Syria With Anti-IS Missile Strike According to a statement released by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the missile strikes on Sunday hit IS command centers in the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor and a bomb-manufacturing facility outside the city. The term takfiri is used by Iranian officials when referring to militant Sunni Muslim fundamentalist groups such as IS. A still image taken from footage shot on June 18, 2017 and broadcast on Iranian Television IRINN, purports to show missiles being fired from Iran into eastern Syria. Old rivalry Tensions between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran have escalated in recent weeks after the Saudis and their Gulf partners cut ties to Qatar, citing, in part, its association to Iran and Tehran's alleged link to terrorism. Iran has stepped up its anti-Saudi rhetoric since the IS-attacks saying Riyadh is trying to destabilize the country by supporting dissidents. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks would only increase hate for the U.S. and Saudi governments, according to state media. U.S. officials told VOA they were close to confirming that an Iranian-made drone shot down by an American fighter jet early Tuesday in Syria was being operated by the IRGC. FILE - An Iranian Shahed-129 drone is displayed by armed forces in a rally commemorating the 37th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran, Iran, Feb. 11, 2016. Iran has been a major military backer of the Syrian regime, first in its war with rebel groups across the country and later against IS. Led by the IRGC, about 10,000 Iranian combat troops are in Syria fighting alongside thousands of fighters from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Tehran-affiliated Shi'ite militia, and assorted Shi'ite militias. FILE - A Shi'ite fighter clashes with members of the Sunni-dominated Free Syrian Army rebel in the town of Hatita, in the countryside of Damascus, Syria, Nov. 22, 2013. Hostilities between U.S.-led forces and Iranian and Russian forces supporting the Syrian regime have escalated in recent weeks in a part of Syria seen as strategically important for the Syrian government and Iran, as Tehran seeks to secure a land corridor between forces it backs in Syria and Iraq. Determined coalition The U.S.-led coalition said that while it is not trying to escalate conflict with Iran and Russia in Syria, it will not back down.

But the news agency has since taken the report down and his alleged involvement has been denied in reports by private news media outlets in Turkey. People carry the coffin of victim of the coup attempt Sehidmiz Murat Inci during his funeral ceremony at the Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara on July 18, 2016. Turkish President Erdogan ordered F-16 fighters to patrol Turkey's skies overnight, although there was no new sign of resistance against the government. Meanwhile, Ankara suspended annual leave for more than three million civil servants. Erdogan said Sunday he is receptive to reinstating the country's death penalty in the aftermath of the coup attempt. But Mogherini warned that such a step may end Turkey's EU membership hopes. A colleague cries as friends carry the coffin of a police officer killed during a failed military coup last Friday, during his funeral at Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara, Turkey, July 17, 2016. Crackdown continues Erdogan has promised to rid Turkey of people involved in the coup attempt. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag says Turkish authorities are accelerating arrests of people, which have included judges, military officers and soldiers. Those in custody include the commander of the Third Army Corps, General Erdal Ozturk, who could face charges of treason. Other high-ranking military officials flew to neighboring Greece by helicopter and requested political asylum. Turkish media reports say some of those who fled are believed to be among the architects of the coup. On Thursday, a court in Athens will decide whether or not to send the military officials back to Turkey for punishment.

Because those who attempt a coup in this country must pay.'' Turkey hasn't executed anyone since 1984, and capital punishment was legally abolished in 2004 as part of Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Mogherini, however, was straight-forward in saying that if Turkey were to institute the death penalty, it would lose all hope of joining the EU. Kerry denies US Involvement Secretary Kerry has denounced suggestions that Washington was involved in Friday's failed coup in Turkey. FILE - Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen is pictured at his residence in Saylorsburg, Pa., Sept. 26, 2013. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Fethullah Gulen, a reclusive cleric now living in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating the violence and demanded that Gulen be extradited. On Saturday, Labor Minister Suleyman Soylu accused Washington of being behind the coup attempt. Gulen has denied being behind the failed coup and dismissed calls for his extradition back to Turkey. Funerals Meanwhile, thousands of people attended funerals Sunday in Istanbul and Ankara for those killed. Prayers were read simultaneously from Turkey's 85,000 mosques at noon to honor those who died. Erdogan openly wept Sunday at the funeral for his top campaign manager and the manager's teenage son who were killed when renegade soldiers opened fire on protesters at the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul on Friday night. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan right, wipes his tears during the funeral of Mustafa Cambaz, Erol and Abdullah Olcak, killed Friday while protesting the attempted coup against Turkey's government, in Istanbul, July 17, 2016. He used a handkerchief to wipe away the tears and turned around as he continued to weep. The government Monday said 208 were killed in the uprising, including 145 civilians, 60 police and three soldiers, in addition to more than 100 coup plotters. Conditions remained tense in Istanbul, Ankara and some other provincial cities, and there were reports of sporadic violence. US military operations Turkey on Sunday also reopened its airspace to military aircraft, allowing the U.S.-led coalition to resume air operations against Islamic State militants. Turkey had closed its airspace following the attempted coup. Turkey, a NATO member, is a key partner in U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State group and has allowed American jets to use its Incirlik air base to fly missions against the extremists in nearby Syria and Iraq.

       " {'content': \" Afghanistan: The Forgotten War of the US Presidential Campaign The Afghan government continues to struggle against a resilient Taliban insurgency. And Obama says his successor will determine the next U.S. move. But neither Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton nor Republican Donald Trump has outlined what they plan to do. Indeed, over the past year the war itself has barely been mentioned by the candidates. Trump, Clinton on Afghan policy Although the United States has dramatically scaled back the number of American troops in Afghanistan, the U.S. remains deeply involved. Obama requested $3.45 billion in the 2017 budget to help fund Afghan security forces. He recommended that his successor maintain funding at that level through 2020. U.S. military trainers continue to advise Afghan forces, and U.S. warplanes carry out strikes to help Afghan units fighting on the ground. Her campaign website does not mention any plans for Afghanistan. Last November, during a speech focused on the Islamic State extremist group, she suggested that Afghanistan should take more responsibility for its own security. Her campaign website, which contains policy papers on a wide range of issues, does not mention any plans for Afghanistan. Trump has been more direct about his thoughts on Afghanistan, at times calling for a complete withdrawal. In January 2013, he tweeted the U.S. should leave Afghanistan immediately. /*<! initInfographics( Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there.

We had real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing. Later that month, Trump told CNN he did not believe Afghanistan was a mistake and rather the U.S should not have involved itself in Iraq. Donald Trump has been more direct about his thoughts on Afghanistan at times calling for a complete withdrawal. Last October, he told CNN the war in Afghanistan was a mistake and he feared the U.S will get stuck there. John C. Fortier, the director of Democracy Project at Bipartisan Policy Center, believes that the past focus on Afghanistan had much to do with the political debate over whether the war in Iraq was a mistake that spread the U.S. military too thin, increasing the challenge in Afghanistan. FILE - Afghan National Army troops arrive in Nad Ali district of Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, Aug. 10, 2016. President Obama requested $3.45 billion in the 2017 budget to help fund Afghan security forces. O'Hanlon says, though, that the war's lower profile this campaign season is not all bad. At a time when threats from Islamic State terrorists, the war in Syria and tensions with Russia and China are the foremost foreign policy priorities for the U.S., some say it's only natural for U.S. officials to focus less on the Afghan conflict. A British soldier guards a site near Kabul's international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, May 17, 2015. Declining U.S. interest in the war reflects in part the declining number of U.S. casualties there. Number of U.S. troops Declining U.S. interest in the war reflects, in part, the fact that there are far fewer Americans in Afghanistan, and U.S. combat-related casualties have fallen to just eight troops killed since the start of this year. Thomas H. Johnson, the director of the Program for Culture & Conflict Studies at the Naval Postgraduate School, makes that point. Johnson said Clinton and her team have not really focused on Afghanistan either, partly due to a string of international terror attacks by Islamic State that have captured the public's attention. But, he said, Islamic State's emergence in Afghanistan about a year ago might help push Afghanistan back to the center of the U.S. policy debate. Afghan leader: Country still needs foreign support| The security situation in Afghanistan remains perilous, and the government remains weak. U.S. military analysts said in a report earlier this year that the government lost control or influence of nearly five percent of its territory between January and May. A top U.S. commander said Afghan forces suffered more than 900 fatalities in July alone. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, center, speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland, July 9, 2016. That month, Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani gathered with top officials from NATO countries in Warsaw to discuss the country's future. Ghani told the gathering that the country will move forward, with help. The United States remains a key part of that effort, but with little discussion of their plans during the U.S. campaign, it is unclear how long that will remain the case under either a Clinton or Trump administration.

       " {'content': \" Ukrainians Want to Make a Deal with Trump Ukrainians trying to figure out what to expect from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may be having trouble. His praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the recent political campaign received a lot of media attention. What will Trump actually do regarding Ukraine? Taras Berezovets, a Kyiv-based political expert, put forward what he sees as a best-case scenario: The United States will remain Ukraine's security guarantor during Trump's presidency; boost financial assistance to Kyiv; provide it with lethal weapons, military trainers and intelligence (to deter Russia from escalating violence in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region); and join the Minsk peace process, aimed at ending the conflict between Ukraine's government and separatist forces backed by Russia. FILE - Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with Ukraine Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in Biden's ceremonial office on the White House complex in Washington, June 15, 2016. Broad US assistance for Kyiv The United States has championed Western sanctions against Russia and has committed more than $1.3 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine and $2 billion in loan guarantees. A $17.5 billion financial package for Kyiv came from the International Monetary Fund, headquartered in Washington. The U.S. also plays a key role in Ukraine's anti-corruption, military and law enforcement reforms. Such a relationship between Ukraine and the new U.S. president is unlikely, according to one high-ranking Russian official. Manafort had to step down as the manager of Trump's presidential campaign in August, following reports that he earned millions of dollars working on behalf of Ukraine's ousted pro-Russian ruler, Viktor Yanukovych, and possibly lobbied illegally on Yanukovych's behalf in the United States. Some of the damaging information came from a Ukrainian anti-corruption agency.

Contrary view from Moscow Media reports earlier this month said Manafort may be advising Trump on Cabinet appointments. Still, he said a telephone conversation between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Trump just days after the U.S. election was ground for optimism.

Welcome Cabinet choices Despite concern in Ukraine about the U.S. president-elect's intentions, some observers are heartened by his Cabinet choices. Sessions also co-sponsored a bill that would authorize the U.S. president to arm Ukraine with lethal military aid. Several names floated for top U.S. diplomat may be music to Kyiv's ears. Mitt Romney famously warned Obama about the danger posed by Russia back in 2008. Senator Bob Corker stressed the need for the U.S. to continue to support Ukraine and called for lethal aid for Ukraine's military. Former U.S. Ambassador the U.N. John Bolton has called for supplying Kyiv with weapons and fast-tracking Ukraine for NATO membership.

Strength, respect (VOA video screengrab) Trump ally predicts cooperation We want to give them anti-air weaponry, anti-drone, counterartillery stuff. Hunter, a Republican from California who was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump, also is a former Marine who visited the Ukrainian military's front lines in Donbas. He contends the U.S. could provide lethal weapons to Ukraine and work with Moscow to secure Russia's withdrawal from Donbas, while giving Putin a free hand in Syria. Regarding Crimea, the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014, Hunter suggested Ukrainians should look at the facts: that Crimea is a Russian stronghold. So, what`s the answer? If Russians are not willing to leave Crimea but they are willing to leave the east of Ukraine, is that a bad thing?\",\n",

The youngest woman, 17-year-old Dolly Kumari Singh, has gone back to school. Like other acid attack victims, she did not dare show her face outside her home after a man burnt her with corrosive chemicals two years ago. But the time she spent working at the cafe gave her the courage to venture back into the classroom. The young women and girls dance and sing to celebrate two years that have ended their isolation and helped them lead normal lives. (A. Pasricha for VOA) said Singh. The acceptance she received at school is in large measure due to the impact of the Sheroes Hangout, which was launched in 2014 by Stop Acid Attacks, a Delhi-based nonprofit group. The cafe was set up to bring acid attack survivors out of isolation and create awareness about the plight of girls and women who had simply vanished from public view. In a male dominated society, the assailants are usually men seeking revenge for spurned marriage proposals, sexual advances or even failing to bring enough dowry. Acid attack survivors, friends and well wishers gather for the anniversary celebrations of the Sheroes Hangout cafe. (A. Pasricha for VOA) That has changed in the past two years as hundreds of customers, Indian and foreign, got to know the women who cook, serve and manage Sheroes Hangout. More than anything, the cafes have given them courage to move on with their lives. Sheroes Cafe run by acid attack survivors in the tourist hub of Agra recently celebrated its second anniversary. (A. Pasricha for VOA) The bursts of laughter, cracking of jokes, singing and dancing, at the anniversary celebrations bear testimony to that. The 18-year-old works at the recently opened cafe in Udaipur. Another feisty young woman, Farah Khan, says that although she never let her spirit die after her former husband sprayed acid on her face six years ago, she feels good when customers talk to her. Indeed, much has been achieved since Sheroes Hangout was launched in Agra. At least 10 private sector organizations have offered jobs to acid attack survivors, who earlier could not have imagined finding employment, which is one of the key reasons the cafe was started. Farah Khan (left) and Dolly Kumari Singh (right) celebrate the second anniversary of Sheroes Hangout in Agra. (A. Pasricha for VOA) Although some could not take advantage of the opportunity because they don't have the necessary education or job skills, the offers represent a huge shift in attitudes, said Alok Dixit, convener of Stop Acid Attacks. In Udaipur, where Sheroes Hangout is located in a shopping mall, which gives it more visibility. Other shops have offered to employ them after noticing people streaming into the cafe in a gesture of support. Alok Dixit, founder of Stop Acid Attacks, which launched the Sheroes cafes. (A. Pasricha for VOA) The ultimate aim is for there to be no need to open more cafes as society begins to accept that acid attack survivors have a right to a normal life. At that point, the survivors will not need a support system. The public gaze was initially not easy to handle, but as she emerged at the forefront of the campaign, she walked the fashion ramp in London to raise awareness of violence against women, modeled for an Indian clothing label, and found love. She has an 18-month-old baby with her partner Alok Dixit. Meanwhile, Dixit focuses on the achievements that he says few people notice. On the streets, the stares have stopped.\",\n",

The sun has burned gold streaks into his stringy brown hair. Donovan Hermans lives here, under trees at the side of Empire Road, warmed by filthy blankets reeking of exhaust fumes, cloaked in chemical smog. He recently saw a woman killed trying to cross the road. Disorganization, chaos His colleague, Ian Watson, has been working the roads for the past 16 years. Roads worse than war zones They speed. They drive under the influence of liquor. They go through red traffic lights. The government said about 14,000 people lose their lives in car crashes in South Africa every year. But independent analysts, like Dembovsky and Carol Smit of the South Africans against Drunk Driving group, dispute this number. This woman carries the scars of a near-fatal car smash, like many thousands of South Africans. Tens of thousands of others suffer severe and crippling injuries. DOT spokespeople did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the statistics and road safety in general in South Africa. The continent is home to 40 of the 50 countries with the highest road death tolls. The WHO put South Africa's road fatalities per 100,000 people at just over 25, a little below the African average of 27. Veteran traffic officer Superintendent Edna Mamonyane says her department needs more manpower to confront the chaos on the roads. Senior Johannesburg Metro Police officer, Edna Mamonyane, said police don't have enough personnel to properly enforce the laws. According to Justice Project research, there are now 11 million licensed drivers in South Africa.\",\n",

       " {'content': \" Francis Celebrates Mass for Thousands in New York Pope Francis celebrated an historic Mass at the Madison Square Garden sports arena in Manhattan before about 20,000 worshipers. The mass ended a busy day in New York. The pontiff urged attendees to reject self-absorption and remember the needy. The atmosphere inside the Garden was absolutely electric and almost raucous at times. She said many wept with tears of joy during his homily. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, thanked the pope for visiting the city. The crowd enthusiastically jumped to its feet and gave Francis a standing ovation that continued for several minutes. The audience seemed quite reluctant to let the pope leave. A crucifix hangs above member of the clergy who watch as Pope Francis, not shown, celebrates Mass at Madison Square Garden, New York, Sept. 25, 2015. Massive crowds turned out earlier to see the 78-year-old pontiff ride through Central Park in his popemobile as he waved to thousands of screaming and applauding people ahead of the Mass. Earlier, he visited Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem. At the school he spoke to students in Spanish, looked at their projects and told them school can become a second home. United Nations visit Friday morning, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly, Pope Francis exhorted presidents and prime ministers to show leadership in combating climate change and poverty and in protecting refugees fleeing conflicts. Pope Francis addresses the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Sept. 25, 2015 at United Nations headquarters. Applause interrupted the pontiff's lengthy speech, especially when he spoke of the need to protect the environment, aid the poor and educate girls. Before the pope's arrival, the great hall had a festive atmosphere, with diplomats greeting one another at the start of the annual meeting. Some were taking selfies, others chatted jovially. /*<! initInfographics( isMobile:true thisSnippet = (d.getElementsByClassName ? eval.innerHTML = userInput; return; var tag = elm.tagName.toLowerCase(); return; js.id = sId; firstJs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, firstJs); thisSnippet.appendChild(bquote); window.twttr.widgets.load(); //fix twitter bug rendering multiple embeds per tweet.

He greeted relatives of some of the people killed in the terrorist attacks on New York City in 2001. Nearly 3,000 died in attacks on that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. At an interfaith meditation service, Francis prayed for peace for all victims of the September 11 attacks, and healing for the family members and friends they left behind. Pope Francis looks at Imam Khalid Latif, right, and Rabbi Elliot J. Cosgrove, left, shaking hands as he arrives for an interfaith service at the Sept. 11 memorial museum in New York, Sept. 25, 2015. Echoes of congressional speech The pope's U.N. address echoed similar concerns he'd raised in a Thursday address to a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress in Washington. He focused heavily on climate change, migration and immigration, but he also reiterated the church's concerns for the sanctity of life. He also urged showing compassion, not closing doors or borders, to cope with the worst refugee crisis since World War II. Praise for nuns Francis flew late Thursday afternoon from Washington to New York, where he began his visit to the nation's financial center with a prayer service at St. Patrick's Cathedral on posh Fifth Avenue. The Vatican and LCWR resolved their differences in April. On to Philadelphia The pope plans to leave New York Saturday morning for two days in Philadelphia, his final U.S. stop. There, he'll attend the Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families and, on Sunday, will celebrate an outdoor Mass expected to draw nearly 2 million people.

       " {'content': \" Women's Rights Face Daunting New Year Worldwide, Activists Warn Women's rights face enormous challenges worldwide in 2017, according to activists, who expect fights to keep health clinics open, to save programs preventing unwanted pregnancies and to enforce laws protecting women from violence. Globally, women's rights are in the crosshairs of rising isolationism and right-wing politics in Western Europe and the United States, where President-elect Donald Trump has promised to unravel an array of policies. Here are what activists see as some of the biggest challenges to women's rights in 2017: FILE - A community health worker holds up contraceptives during a lecture on family planning at a reproductive health clinic run by an NGO in Tondo city, Manila, Jan. 12, 2016. Global access to abortion, contraception A threat to abortion access is the likely reinstatement of the so-called global gag rule under the Trump administration. First imposed under former President Ronald Reagan, the rule prohibits groups getting U.S. aid abroad from providing abortions or counseling patients about abortions, even if their funds for those activities come from other sources. The rule was lifted by President Barack Obama in 2009, but can be reinstated with the stroke of a pen. Under the gag rule, many groups turned down U.S. aid, leaving them short of money for health services from cancer screenings to flu shots, advocates say. The United States also could pull funding from the United Nations Population Fund, which provides access to reproductive health services but does not fund or support abortion. FILE - A woman protests against underage marriages in Lagos, Nigeria, July 20, 2013. Keeping women's organizations operating globally Women's groups work around the world on such issues as divorce rights, gender wage gaps and child marriage, often operating in hostile environments on shoestring budgets. Several countries have enacted laws pressuring such groups by making them register as foreign agents if they get funding from international donors, said Janet Walsh, acting director of women's rights division at Human Rights Watch. At the same time, funding from U.S. government sources is likely to shrink, she said. FILE - A photo of Lucia Perez,16, who was raped and killed in Argentina, is projected on a building as women participate in a demonstration against gender violence in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Oct. 25, 2016. Violence against women One in three women has experienced physical or sexual violence, most commonly inflicted by a partner, statistics show. An estimated one in five will become a victim of rape or attempted rape, according to the United Nations, and high rates of femicide and domestic abuse grip many countries. It is a health crisis. Loss of U.S. as leader in women's rights The U.S. government has in recent years played a key role in promoting and supporting women's rights, especially helping draw up global development goals approved by the United Nations, one of which calls for gender equality by 2030. The IWHC intends to press governments not to cave to U.S. pressure to backpedal on women's rights, a strategy used during the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush that also sought to undermine women's rights, she said. FILE - Renee Bracey Sherman of Chicago, Illinois, celebrates at the Supreme Court in Washington, June 27, 2016, after the court struck down Texas' widely replicated regulation of abortion clinics. Abortion rights in the U.S. Anti-abortion advocates want to repeal Roe v. Wade, the 1972 Supreme Court decision making abortion legal. Trump will have an opportunity to name one or more justices to the highest court and has vowed they will be abortion opponents. In the meantime, state laws are chipping away at abortion rights. Texas lawmakers approved a law requiring burial of aborted fetal tissue, a measure estimated to cost hundreds of dollars per procedure, and Ohio signed into law a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. FILE - A health care enrollment fair, co-sponsored by Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, is held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Nov. 9, 2013. Access to contraception in the U.S. Trump has said he would appeal some or all of the Affordable Care Act, which has provided 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Known as Obamacare, it pays for most birth control methods for women. Defunding of Planned Parenthood Defunding Planned Parenthood, which runs about 650 women's health centers nationwide, was a battle cry of Trump during the presidential campaign and a favorite cause of Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Planned Parenthood relies on public funding for at least half its revenue, much of it from the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. Congress also could stop funding Title X programs that provide family planning services to low-income women and from an array of teen pregnancy prevention programs.\",\n",

FILE - Paramilitary policemen march at the Tiananmen Sqaure before the fourth plenary meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 14, 2013. Analysts note that while there may be a tendency from military and party hardliners in China to call for a tough response, Chinese officials and state media have so far focused more on the economic measures China could use in response and a refusal to cooperate on a wide-range of issues from Iran to North Korea. Taiwan is also watching all of this closely to make sure its interests are looked after. Nixon in reverse U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972 spearheaded the beginning of what led to the switch in ties from Taiwan to China. At the time, one key reason for establishing relations with Beijing, analysts note, was to counter Russia. Now that may be happening again, but in reverse.

He added that while there are many uncertainties, what is clear is that Trump is prepared to play hardball with China on both trade and strategic issues. On the campaign trail, president-elect Trump sent clear signals that he wants to improve ties with Russia. On Tuesday, he appointed ExxonMobil Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as his Secretary of State. Tillerson is friendly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

       " {'content': \" Harder vs. Softer, the Republican and Democratic Foreign Policy Platforms In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention Thursday night, Donald Trump laid out a foreign policy vision that marked a sharp departure from that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The platform, a statement of party principles and ideas, is a non-binding document, but it does serve as a road map for presidential candidates. Party nominees, even when they espouse unconventional views, tend not to veer far from its positions. With its emphasis on the use of diplomacy and economic development, the Democratic platform embraces what is known as idealism, a school of foreign policy that holds that America is a force for good in the world and that, with a combination of military strength and soft power, can shape global affairs. More than twice as long on foreign policy as the Democratic version, the Republican platform presents a harder-edged, Reaganesque manifesto with some, but by no means all, of Trump's controversial ideas. Hard vs soft Participants attend the NATO Summit in Warsaw, Poland, July 8, 2016. Iran Israel Bipartisan support for Israel has long been a cornerstone of American foreign policy. Both platforms offer unequivocal support for the Jewish state, but a subtle change in the Republican plank separates the two parties. Comparison of Foreign Policy Planks The Democratic draft retains the two-state solution language. It says the status of Jerusalem is a matter of final negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians, but should nonetheless remain the capital of Israel. Islamic State The Democrats pledge to lead the anti-Islamic State coalition while working toward a political settlement to end the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gives a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, April 27, 2016. But little of that rhetoric is to be found in the Republican platform. China Both platforms are censorious of Chinese trade practices and growing military posturing in the South China Sea. Comparison of Foreign Policy Planks Russia Afghanistan/Pakistan On Afghanistan and Pakistan, the policy differences are hardly noticeable. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, center, speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland, July 9, 2016.
